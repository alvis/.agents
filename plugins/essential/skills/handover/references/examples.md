# Handover examples

```bash
/essential:handover
# Indexes every state_root/.state/works/<work-id>/ stream — the default
# source tree's, whichever checkout you run from — refreshes each continuable
# stream (planned/working, including separately blocked streams), leaves
# reviewing/completed streams as awaiting/index-only rows, and updates the global .state/overview.md beside
# them. No file is written outside .state/.
```

```bash
/essential:handover auth-refresh
# Optional filter: index all streams but refresh only the matching continuable
# stream(s). Refreshes .state/works/auth-refresh/state.md and
# state/working.md and reconciles its lazy indexes.
```

```bash
/essential:takeover
# Resume. Offers every incomplete stream in the centralized works/, read from
# on-disk state files, and reads overview.md for each stream's Location. Picking
# a stream worked in another checkout switches the working directory there
# first. It settles reviewing streams against their applicable landing evidence before
# offering the next task. One stream at a time.
```

A `reviewing` or `completed` stream is **not** an error: it stays an awaiting
or index-only row and gets no refresh. An archived stream lives outside
`works/` and is not indexed. Invalid work IDs and a missing Essential contract path are
explicit errors. Every stream records exact specification links or `- Specification: None`; a
generic coding stream cannot omit the provenance line. There is no
prefix-based or root-file compatibility fallback.

## Two streams

`web-auth` (`working`) and `legacy-import` (`completed`) get one `overview.md`
row each; only `web-auth` has its `state.md` and `state/working.md` rewritten. A
later takeover offers `web-auth` for selection and excludes `legacy-import` by
name. When two continuable streams sit on **different** source anchors, takeover
resumes the one matching the current checkout and switches the working directory
for the other — the state is shared, so only the checkout changes.

## Pause and resume

To pause, `/essential:handover` refreshes each stream's `state.md` (including
the `## Continuation` fields, which name the next owner, next action,
continuation intent, and source anchor) and `state/working.md`, and upserts its
row in the global `.state/overview.md`. That persistence always completes,
so the session can then close. In a new session, `/essential:takeover` with no
argument offers every incomplete stream read straight from on-disk state, and
reads `overview.md` for each one's `Location` — switching the working directory
to that checkout if the chosen stream is worked elsewhere.

Each stream's `Continuation intent` names the capability-level work type — for
example specification-led implementation versus generic coding implementation —
never a fixed skill name; takeover maps it to the relevant implementation skill
and rejects a missing or contradictory intent.

## Specifications and local-only changes

A project or stream specification may have multiple source documents. Keep
project-level entry points in the global overview and every exact stream
document in that stream's charter:

```markdown
## Specifications

- [Project hub](https://notion.so/acme/project-hub)
- [Documentation index](https://notion.so/acme/documentation-index)

## Specification provenance

- Specification: [Authentication requirements](https://notion.so/acme/authentication-requirements)
- Specification: [Authentication API contract](https://notion.so/acme/authentication-api)
```

The first two links are project entry points; the last two are exact links for
one stream and must not be copied into the global overview.

A stream whose relevant repository changes exist only in the working copy is
still persisted and still resumable — the pause records exactly what is
uncommitted, and never returns `handover: blocked`.

For a Notion-backed specification, `state.md` records the stable page ref and
captured revision so a resume fetches it fresh, plus the merge base a re-publish
needs. If the live specification source is unreachable at handover time, mark
the provenance stale and note it.
