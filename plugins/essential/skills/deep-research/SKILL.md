# Deep Research

Systematic multi-source fact-finding: analyze sources in parallel, iteratively discover new ones from what they reveal, adversarially test each load-bearing claim before it can enter the report, and synthesize a cited report with explicit confidence ratings and knowledge gaps. Metric-driven candidate optimization belongs to `essential:autoresearch`.

## Boundaries

- Use for: investigating complex or multi-domain topics, comparing evidence across sources, gathering current information, and producing a fact-finding deliverable with citations, confidence ratings, and uncertainty notes.
- Do not use for: questions a single web search answers, optimizing candidates against a scoreable metric (`essential:autoresearch`), or any output without source attribution — every finding must trace to its sources.

## Inputs

- **Required**: a research topic (`$ARGUMENTS`).
- **Optional**: a focus area narrowing the topic's scope.
- **Prerequisites**: `internet search capability`/`page-retrieval capability` available for external topics; restricted or non-public topics are declined with a suggested public reframing.

Before creating or materially rewriting a project artifact, read the absolute `state.md` path injected by Essential. If unavailable, stop artifact writes and report the missing contract. Resolve the active work directory from that contract.

## Workflow

Steps 2, 3, and 4 dispatch subagents per `plugins/governance/standards/delegation/`; skill-specific bounds are stated at each step. Compose each first task handover from [subagent-handover.md](../../references/directions/subagent-handover.md), with source batches or claims in its task-specific Context.

1. **Plan the run.** Parse the topic and optional focus from `$ARGUMENTS` and pick the source strategy by topic type — technical/scientific: academic papers, documentation, code repositories; historical: primary sources, archives, temporal progression; current events: recent news and real-time updates; theoretical: foundational texts balanced with recent work; product/market: industry reports, user feedback, competitive analysis. Create `artifacts/research/<topic-slug>/` under the active work directory, with `source-tracker.md` listing each source's URL/path, credibility class (Academic/Official/Industry/Community), discovery level, discovered-from source, and status (pending/analyzing/analyzed/failed). If the tracker already exists, resume instead: keep completed analyses and continue from every `pending` or `analyzing` source.
2. **Analyze sources in parallel.** Dispatch source-analysis subagents — at most ~10 sources per subagent, independent batches in one parallel message, each report under 1000 tokens. Each subagent reports, per source: key information relevant to the topic, cross-source patterns and themes, contradictions and debates, new insights naming candidate sources for further research, and the source's **falsifiable claims** — concrete, checkable statements bearing on the topic, each with a direct supporting quote and an importance rating (central/supporting/tangential) per [references/claim-verification.md](references/claim-verification.md). Update `source-tracker.md` after every returned analysis — the tracker is the checkpoint that makes the run resumable. A subagent that times out marks its sources `failed`; continue with the available data.
3. **Iterate on discoveries.** When an analysis surfaces an unfamiliar concept, a referenced work, an understanding gap, or a contradiction needing more context: add the discovered sources to the tracker immediately with their discovery level and origin, dispatch analysis for high-relevance ones first (priority = relevance + credibility), and record the connection chain (source → insight → new source). Bounds that keep the run convergent: at most 3 discovery levels; near-duplicate sources are checked for content similarity before analysis and recorded as duplicates; circular references are documented, never re-analyzed. Stop iterating early once convergent evidence from multiple credible sources answers the research question; if no sources are found at all, widen the search parameters once before reporting the gap.
4. **Adversarially verify claims.** Do not promote claims on convergence alone; test them. Pool the extracted claims, rank them, and run a three-vote skeptical panel per claim exactly as [references/claim-verification.md](references/claim-verification.md) specifies: dispatch three independent adversarial-verifier subagents (one vote per claim each, ~25 claims max per verifier, each report under ~1000 tokens), each trying to refute. A claim is **refuted** when at least 2 of 3 votes refute it — it cannot become a finding; **confirmed** when it has ≥2 valid votes and fewer than 2 refute; **unverified** when fewer than 2 votes were cast (an infrastructure failure, never a refutation). Record each claim's outcome and vote margin (`support-refute`) in the tracker. Carry refuted and unverified claims forward for the report's transparency and caveats sections rather than dropping them silently.
5. **Synthesize.** Merge and group **confirmed claims only**; refuted and unverified claims never enter findings. Resolve remaining conflicts by source priority (credibility class, then convergence). Apply the synthesis framework: convergent evidence (multiple sources supporting one conclusion), divergent perspectives (contrasting viewpoints kept with their context), confidence scoring per the rule in [references/deliverable-format.md](references/deliverable-format.md) (which folds in the vote margin), and explicit knowledge gaps wherever evidence is insufficient.
6. **Write the deliverable** as `report.md` in the research directory, following the section order and confidence rules in [references/deliverable-format.md](references/deliverable-format.md), and remove temporary scratch files so only the tracker, findings, and deliverable remain.
7. Run the verification below; when a check fails, fix the cause and re-run that check. Repeat until every check passes or a concrete blocker remains, then report the blocker instead of looping.

## Verification

- Every source marked `analyzed` in `source-tracker.md` has a summary, and every discovered source is tracked with its level and origin.
- Discovery chains are valid: each level 2+ source traces back through source → insight → new source.
- Every finding traces to a **confirmed** claim (≥2 valid votes, fewer than 2 refutes); no refuted or unverified claim is presented as a finding.
- Each verified claim records its outcome and vote margin; unverified claims are attributed to panel failure, never conflated with refuted ones.
- Every finding cites its sources; contradictions are documented rather than silently resolved; gaps are stated explicitly.
- The deliverable contains every section required by [references/deliverable-format.md](references/deliverable-format.md), including the refuted- and unverified-claim sections.

## Completion

Deliver the report and state: total sources analyzed (initial vs discovered, and depth reached), claims verified with confirmed/refuted/unverified counts, overall confidence with its basis, the key findings in one line each, and the open research gaps. If every claim was refuted, report the research as inconclusive; if every panel failed (all unverified), report the infrastructure failure and advise a retry rather than "nothing found." A partial or blocked run still reports the tracker state, what was analyzed, and the blocker — the tracker makes the run resumable later. Return explicit final paths generated or materially rewritten as `generated_files`; the main agent size-checks only eligible work Markdown inside the target `.state/`.
