# Naming

Read this before naming or citing a work stream, task, branch, pull request,
commit, or generated document.
Every name here is decided by following these rules — there is no deriving
executable, and none should be written.

## Slugs

Lowercase ASCII words joined by single hyphens. Fold accents to their base
letter, drop everything else, and collapse runs of separators to one hyphen:
`Crème brûlée déjà vu` is `creme-brulee-deja-vu`, `Payments / refunds?! v2.0`
is `payments-refunds-v2-0`. Shorten by dropping whole trailing words, never
part of a word.

Keep a slug at or under 48 bytes, which is the widest a generated filename
gets before it stops fitting a listing. Where one word is longer than that on
its own, cut the word — there is no smaller boundary left to keep.

A name with nothing to fold — `影師嗎` — leaves an empty slug, which is not a
name. Write an English slug for what the thing is instead; the source string
was never the identity, only the usual shortest route to one.

## Work ID

A slug naming what the work is about, kept at or under 32 bytes — the ID is
repeated in every state path, in the source tree path, and in a branch that
itself nests under a type and over a numbered child, so 32 keeps the longest of those
(`feat/<work-id>/01-<scope>`) inside a terminal column and a PR title. That
bound is the convention, not a gate: a longer name chosen deliberately is
honoured, and only the shape is enforced, since a name outside the grammar
does not survive the trip through a path and a branch. The ID carries no type
prefix — the type belongs to the branch, not to the identity:

```text
work-id-naming
contract-footprint-budget
eng-421-checkout-refunds      # a stream that came from a tracker keeps its key
```

That one name is the stream's state directory (`.state/works/<work-id>/`) and
its source tree directory (`~/.workspaces/<project>/<work-id>`). Every message,
record, hand-off, and status update begins with one stable reference: the Work
ID for a lifecycle-managed stream, otherwise the runtime Task ID exactly as the
harness supplied it. When the message identifies Git history, use its PR ID or
full Git commit SHA once that history exists. An ordinal or packaging label
such as `slice 1` or `slice 2` never stands in for one of those identifiers.

Three shapes recur, and none of them is a work ID:

- **No date prefix** — `20260727-refunds`. The date is already in the journal,
  the branch, and the commit, so in the ID it spends the 32-byte budget on a
  fact recorded three times over, and it sorts streams by when someone started
  them rather than by what they are.
- **No type prefix** — `feat-refunds`. The type belongs to the branch, and
  `feat/refunds` and `fix/refunds` resolve to the same stream; carrying it in
  the ID gives one identity two names and invites a second directory for work
  the first already owns.
- **No random suffix** — `refunds-v5cfxb`. Collisions are settled by reading
  `works/` and `archive/` and taking the next free
  ordinal, so the suffix defends against a collision that lookup has already
  ruled out — at the cost of a name nobody can say, type, or recognise.

An ID already on disk is never renamed to correct its shape: it is an
identity, and identities do not change to satisfy a rule written later. The
repair is forward-only — mint the next name right.

A work ID is an identity and is never reused — a rule nothing enforces, so it
holds only if you check. Before taking one, read every ID under `works/` **and**
`archive/`; if the name is occupied, append the next free ordinal — shortening
the scope first so the ordinal still fits in 32 bytes, since `<31-byte-name>-2`
would not. That ordinal makes a distinct stream, not a slice of the one it
collided with.

`archive/` is permanent — no skill deletes it — so those two directories
together are a complete record of which IDs are spoken for, and the resolver
reads both. They are still not the whole answer: a name is taken while **any**
trace of it survives, including a branch, a source tree, or a merged pull
request left by a stream whose directory was removed by hand. Take a colliding
name only after establishing that nothing is still using it.

## Branch

The branch is the work ID under a conventional-commit type: `<type>/<work-id>`.
A stream that is one pull request is that branch alone; a stream split into a
stack or into sub-tasks is a set of numbered branches beneath it, ordinals
always exactly two digits:

```text
feat/<work-id>                    # the whole stream, one PR
feat/<work-id>/01-resolver        # a stack or sub-task split
feat/<work-id>/02-contract
feat/<work-id>/03-docs
```

So a work ID of `work-id-naming` gives `feat/work-id-naming`, and its numbered
branches are `feat/work-id-naming/01-resolver` and so on. The type describes the
branch, never the identity: it is not part of the ID or the state path, and
`fix/work-id-naming` resolves to the same stream as `feat/work-id-naming`.

Git stores refs as files, so `feat/<work-id>` and `feat/<work-id>/01-resolver`
cannot both exist — creating the second while the first is present fails with
`cannot lock ref`, locally and on the remote alike. A stream that grows past
one pull request therefore cannot add a numbered branch beside the bare one;
it **renames** the bare branch into the first numbered branch, which frees the namespace
in the same operation that vacates it. Both refs need it: `git branch -m`
(or `jj bookmark rename`) clears the local namespace, and the forge's own
branch rename clears the remote one while retargeting the open pull request —
never delete the remote ref instead, since that closes the pull request on it.

Renaming leaves this checkout pointing at a ref that is gone. Run
`git fetch --prune` and reset the renamed branch's upstream before pushing
anything: a stale `origin/<type>/<work-id>` fails the next
`--force-with-lease` with `stale info`, because the lease is a claim about a
remote value that no longer exists, and the same stale flat ref blocks
fetching the numbered child that has taken its name. Only once both renames
and that prune have landed do the later numbered branches push.

The segment after the ordinal is a semantic scope label for branch readability,
not an identity or a substitute for the stable reference above. Name that scope,
not the PR archetype selected from
`coding:skills/pr/references/create-update.md`.

Naming the branch this way is what lets the workspace resolution step select
the stream from whichever branch is checked out. Only these two shapes
resolve; anything else means the main agent asks instead — which is the intended
outcome, not a failure.

## Documents

- A durable directory entrypoint is the fixed uppercase filename `README.md`;
  operational indexes and semantic documents keep descriptive lowercase names.
- Work-local specification files use `.state/works/<work-id>/spec/` and take the owning capability, never the task title.
- ADRs alone carry a zero-padded monotonic numeric prefix
  (`docs/architecture/decisions/0007-<decision-slug>.md`) and are never
  renumbered. Superseded ADRs keep that filename under
  `decisions/superseded/`.
- Ordinary work-local children take unnumbered semantic `<slug>.md` names —
  never `part-1`, `misc`, or the task title.
- Numbered `<nn>-<topic-slug>.md` children, in increments of 10, are reserved
  for the mechanical split of an oversized file.
- Two documents whose names would collide in the same directory: the later one
  takes the next free ordinal, as a work ID does (`change-explainer.md`, then
  `change-explainer-2.md`) — shortening the base first where the ordinal would
  not otherwise fit in 48 bytes. Never overwrite a sibling to claim its name.
