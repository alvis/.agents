# Team lifecycle and intelligence

Read this when forming a team, spawning or retiring a teammate, or choosing
a worker's intelligence.

## Team lifecycle

- **Form a team when delegation carries signal** — large or high-output work;
  stay inline for trivial, conversational, or small tasks.
- **Keep teammates hot.** Route related work to an idle teammate whose loaded
  context still fits.
- **Terminate the unneeded.** Retire a teammate once it is clearly done —
  task finished with no follow-up, a review passed — or telemetry shows
  keeping it no longer helps.
- **Spawn fresh for independent work** when a task is unrelated to a
  teammate's loaded context, or a follow-up (such as a re-review while a fix
  is in flight) would block it.
- **Keep nested spawning one-off.** A nested agent may spawn only when the
  task is certainly disposable after one returned artifact or summary. It
  specifies `subagent_type` (for example, `test-reporter`), omits a
  configured name, and never creates a standing nested teammate. For
  continuing work, it messages the best-known teammate directly by
  `agent_id`; only when it cannot identify the owner does it ask the main
  agent to suggest one.
- **Bound exceptional fan-out.** Declare a task-wide child-spawn budget
  before the first one-off nested spawn; default to three. Direct teammate-messaging capability
  hand-offs to known `agent_id`s don't spend it, but the same task must not
  cross the same sibling edge twice.
- **Hand off by reference.** The first message follows
  [subagent-handover.md](../directions/subagent-handover.md). Later
  messages carry only deltas. If
  the direct teammate-messaging capability is unavailable, return the compact hand-off to the caller.
- **Keep agent definitions role-specific.** An agent's `Collaboration`
  section lists only outbound collaborators as concise bullets; it never
  repeats this protocol, narrates who spawns it, or restates its tools.

## Intelligence

Choose the lowest intelligence whose `best_for` examples cover the task, using
the authoritative ranks and examples in
`skills/install-agents/references/intelligence-levels.json`. Agent metadata
declares the role's level; harness adapters alone translate it into native
model and effort fields. Resolve `inherit` from the active harness projection
before dispatch. Use its exact configured rank, or the highest configured rank
for the same model when the active effort exceeds every configured effort.
Treat other missing or ambiguous projections as ineligible.
