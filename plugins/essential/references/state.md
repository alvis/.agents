# State lifecycle

Read [state-systems.md](state-systems.md) before working on any project, then read this contract before lifecycle-managed work. Local state is the working memory and project-management record throughout the work lifecycle. This contract defines its paths, ownership, and promotion. Domain skills own artifact content; Essential owns this cross-plugin lifecycle. All lead-role agents must read [truth.md](truth.md) once before working on any project: it defines the kinds of truth these artifacts carry, the constitutional rules, validity, and `capability_id`. Per-moment detail lives in the references named below; read each when its moment arrives, not before.

## Resolve the workspace first

The injected instruction gives the absolute path to this file. Derive the Essential plugin root from that path, then run the resolver from inside the target repository:

```bash
STATE_REFERENCE='<absolute state.md path injected by Essential>'
ESSENTIAL_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "$STATE_REFERENCE")/.." && pwd)"
"$ESSENTIAL_ROOT/scripts/resolve-state-workspace"
```

A normal invocation is read-only; `--bootstrap` is the explicit main-agent-only creation mode below. The resolver chooses identity in this order: explicit `--work-id`, `STATE_WORK_ID`, a work directory matching the Git branch/jj workspace label, then a sole existing workspace-local work directory only when the workspace label is generic or unavailable. Branch and workspace names may identify existing work but never create a new identity; `work_id_source` records the choice. Resolver output identifies a candidate location, not charter ownership. On `work_id_required`, no work path is selected: a main-agent caller follows [establish-work-stream.md](../directions/establish-work-stream.md), selects contextually, and reruns with `--work-id`; a subagent returns the complete payload to the main agent. Nobody treats a detached checkout or generic `main`, `master`, `trunk`, or `default` label as a new identity. The resolver's `--help` enumerates every output field; the essentials:

- `durable_root` is the active workspace root for versioned project documents and `.gitignore` (`repo_root` is its alias); it follows the tree the caller is working in, and is where `docs/` promotion lands.
- `state_root` is the **default source tree** — Git's main worktree or the jj workspace registered as `default` — the one tree carrying the ignored `.state/`, falling back to `active_workspace` when none is discoverable. `work_dir` is always `state_root/.state/works/<work-id>/`, whichever tree the caller is in.
- Work state is centralized, never per-tree, and never committed: every tree reads the same `.state/`. Two trees must not run the same stream concurrently — that is what the main-agent lease enforces.

`resolved` with `state_ignored: true` is a hard bootstrap gate before any work artifact or probe is written. On `requires_ignore`, every worker stops and reports the returned `ignore_file` — the **default source tree's** `.gitignore`, the tree that carries `.state/`. The main agent alone adds the exact `.state/` rule there, includes that path in `generated_files`, and reruns the resolver. A sync-only or ad hoc `git check-ignore` probe does not replace this bootstrap contract.

### First-use work-memory bootstrap

For substantial work, follow [establish-work-stream.md](../directions/establish-work-stream.md) before the first-use bootstrap. It owns contextual identity selection, charter-safe reuse, the three intent checks, workspace selection, and their order. After its gates are settled, this lifecycle owns the resolved state paths; [lease.md](lease.md) owns the lease-verified invocation, no-clobber semantics, initial content, and returned paths that enter `generated_files`.

## Canonical topology

Version-controlled documentation follows the active working tree; ignored `.state/` lives only in the default source tree (`state_root`). Their complete trees have one owner each: [durable-documentation.md](durable-documentation.md) and [work-memory-topology.md](work-memory-topology.md). This lifecycle links to them and does not repeat either tree.

## Deterministic names

Read [naming.md](naming.md) before naming a work stream, branch, or generated document. It owns every shape and collision rule. A Work ID is a type-free, stable identity selected by the main agent after charter ownership and collisions are settled; it is never renamed or reused.

## Work memory

### Global overview (`.state/overview.md`)

The default source tree carries `.state/`, and with it the single global `overview.md`: an authored `Goal` and `Requirements` preamble, the questions waiting on the user, the project-level `State systems` presence section, then one row per work stream. Every stream's state sits under the same `works/`, so this is an index over local state, not a cross-tree aggregator; its `Location` column records **which checkout each stream is worked in**, one tree per stream. Every table cell derives from each stream's own files, so a stale table is rebuilt by re-reading them; the preamble is not. Environment narrative and known traps are not preamble — they live beside the overview in `environment.md` and `traps.md`, because they change when the repository does, not when a stream advances. The main agent updates the overview whenever a stream's phase changes or it becomes blocked or unblocked — in particular at handover. Sections, columns, and each cell's derivation live in [overviews.md](overviews.md).

`State systems` records that version-controlled documentation and local operational state are available and whether an external specification authority is `configured`, `none`, or `pending`. It contains no specification URL or revision; each stream's exact anchors live only in its `goal.md` under `## Specification provenance`.

The Streams table is documentation-only: its column is `Documentations` and may contain durable `docs/` links and capability references, but never specification links. When a legacy `Spec` cell is encountered, the main agent verifies and preserves its stream-local provenance before removing the cell in the same atomic overview publication. Unverified legacy values stay pending rather than becoming project links or `None`.

### One stream at a time

Work **one** stream to completion before starting another: at most one stream sits at phase `working` or `reviewing`. A `reviewing` stream holds that slot even while it waits, since a verdict can send the work back, and being blocked never frees it. Finished execution sets phase `reviewing`, not a terminal state; `completed` needs the stream's applicable landing evidence, never the author's say-so. Coding work lands by merge or presence on the default branch. Non-coding work lands by explicit acceptance plus durable promotion or an evidenced `not required` promotion receipt. A reviewing stream may be blocked on that external landing or acceptance wait after every required leaf is done; completion clears that resolved submission blocker and retains only independently unresolved blockers. Read [stream-completion.md](stream-completion.md) when a stream finishes or is settled.

### `goal.md`

`goal.md` is the work stream's charter: the goal, scope and non-goals, numbered success criteria (`SC-1`, `SC-2`, …) each with expected acceptance evidence, specification provenance, and the stream's `## Workspace anchors` (the resolved git/jj workspace by default; other kinds per [anchors.md](anchors.md)). It carries `Charter revision: N`, bumped only on explicit user approval and journaled — the charter separates what "done" means from where the work stands, so status churn can never drift the definition of success. For a Notion-backed contract the canonical specification wins every conflict, and charter drift after a new base is a user decision, never a silent edit. Task `Acceptance` cells, `changes/` children, and `reviews/alignment.md` findings cite `SC-n` IDs so closure is checkable.

### `state/working.md` and `state.md`

`state/working.md` is a temporary, narrow lens on what is being worked on now — current focus, handback point, and fast paths only; the main agent is its only writer; aim for ~4,096 bytes editorially, with no mechanical gate. A subagent reads it only for current-work navigation and reads `state.md` for resume, planning, alignment, or when explicitly assigned; it reports paths, evidence, and state deltas to the main agent and never edits main-agent-owned work memory.

`state.md` is the complete resumable execution context: full plan, the stream's phase and what it is blocked on, its completion receipt once it has one, decisions, dependencies, blockers, open questions, review state, evidence references, repository revision, and sync state. It links to the charter rather than restating it, carries `Plan revision: N` (each bump appends what/why/approver/spec base-id to `state/revisions.md`), the monotonic `State revision: N`, and the inventory of `proposals/` children awaiting approval or approved-but-unimplemented, kept current the moment a proposal changes. Detail lives in semantic `state/*.md` children; `state.md` references rather than copies. Every new or explicitly rewritten state file follows [the work-state contract](state-format.md); state is free-form, LLM-readable Markdown with no separate validation step — read it directly and judge. Preserve any existing state file byte-for-byte until an explicit rewrite; older shapes migrate lazily at the next explicit main-agent rewrite, journaled, never on read.

### Persistence and the main-agent lease

Persist state immediately, never lazily — append first, reconcile second. The moment a task changes status, a decision is made, a revision is approved, or a sync event lands, the lease holder appends one journal line (grammar in the work-state contract and the journal's own header) and then reconciles the affected tables. The journal is append-only; the tables in `state.md`, the lazy overviews, and `overview.md` are views over it, so suspected drift is settled by re-reading the journal. State in `.state/` is the operational projection of the work, not the record of record: deleting it may cost convenience and execution detail, but must never erase an accepted decision, approved contract, published artifact identity, or unresolved critical risk — those live in versioned docs and durable promotion records; every state change, discovery, and decision lands immediately in the journal and its owning file. This discipline bounds crash loss to one journal line. A worker without the lease returns its status change and evidence in its output manifest immediately; the lease holder reconciles it at once.

The main agent holds the work item's lease and is the sole writer anywhere under `.state/`. It never grants this authority to a reviewer or other subagent. Subagents return proposed child content, paths, evidence, and reconciliation deltas; the main agent applies them. The lease is on disk, not just convention — never write under a live foreign lease, and claim an expired lease only through the explicit takeover verb, journaled as a `lease` event. Verbs, the write protocol, and the `State revision` bump live in [lease.md](lease.md); read it before any main-agent state write.

### Overviews, decisions, and reviews

Create `proposals.md`, `changes.md`, `decisions.md`, or `design.md` with the first child in its folder and reconcile them per [overviews.md](overviews.md) — including the proposals-vs-changes distinction, canonical child statuses, and deviation provenance. Decisions follow [decision-causality.md](decision-causality.md); accepting one triggers the blast-radius sweep. Reviews follow [reviews.md](reviews.md): `review.md` rolls up the seven canonical review areas plus any plugin-namespaced areas, and work closes only when the roll-up agrees with every detail.

## Specification lifecycle

An explicit local path, approved inline candidate, or selected Notion identity may supply a specification; inline prompt text is evidence only until it becomes an approved candidate in the active work's `spec/`. Neither path claims a Notion round trip. Spec freshness is checked at named moments — materialize before planning, before each dispatch batch, before review, and at completion — and a changed base triggers the revalidation sweep (non-done dependents `! blocked`; done rows keep `✓ done` and gain stale validity plus remediation tasks). Mirrors, materialization, the sweep procedure, the authored-docs sweep, and completion verification live in [spec-lifecycle.md](spec-lifecycle.md); mid-execution change routing lives in [change-control.md](change-control.md).

## Evidence, continuity, and retirement

Keep logs, screenshots, captures, binaries, and large raw evidence outside Markdown; work artifacts store concise results plus source-bound paths, revisions, hashes, and dispositions. Resumable findings belong in `state/discovery.md`; source material belongs in `artifacts/`; only durable conclusions are promoted to `docs/`.

Continuity has one mechanism: the on-disk work directory. A handover completes the stream's state and updates `overview.md`, both under the default source tree's `.state/`; a resume reads those files and continues from whichever tree the reader is in, since every tree resolves to the same state. Nothing else is needed — the directory holds state, decisions, specification, and `artifacts/` together, and each stream records the source anchor that names the revision its work assumes. Handover scopes to the stream being paused and releases the main-agent lease.

Remember that `.state/` is ignored: one reflexive `git clean -fdx` deletes every stream on the machine, silently. A copy of `.state/` kept outside the repository is the designed recovery — take one before a stream carries non-recoverable decisions, and promote durable knowledge early. [essential:doctor](../skills/doctor/SKILL.md) checks a recovered tree's structural integrity before it is resumed. Idle streams are parked and completed streams retired per [retirement.md](retirement.md); retirement permanently archives the operational projection, so it is gated on promotion and decision dispositions. A completed stream's directory moves into `archive/` — the one sink for everything that leaves `works/` — when its overview row is dropped. The archive is permanent; this lifecycle does not delete archived streams.

## Write boundary

[state-systems.md](state-systems.md) owns the complete boundary: all agents may read the configured systems, but only the main agent writes them. A local lifecycle write lands under the **default source tree's** `.state/` (the resolver's `state_root`); durable promotion lands in root `README.md` or `docs/**` in the active tree; an external specification write goes through its owning specification workflow. A subagent never receives a lease or direct write grant for any of these systems and instead returns a reconciliation payload. Assigned production source and test files outside these systems are unaffected.

**Output volume is never a reason to create a file.** A report that would be long is shortened editorially or degraded to pointers into `.state/` — the state is already on disk, so a pointer loses nothing. Where a generated carrier genuinely must exist as a file — a `git format-patch` patch, a bundle, a captured log — its only legal home is `.state/works/<work-id>/artifacts/`, so it travels with the work directory. This is also the destination for the general instruction to externalize long detail to a task-owned artifact. A main agent that has not cleared the `requires_ignore` gate writes nothing at all and reports.

## Structural doctor

`"$ESSENTIAL_ROOT/skills/doctor/scripts/state-doctor" --work-dir <work_dir> \ --repository-root <durable_root>` is a read-only structural checker (broken IDs, cycles, contradictory statuses, missing evidence annotations, dead links, unsuperseded decisions, lease conflicts, overview drift). It never judges prose or blocks by default — findings inform the main agent's own reading. Run it before large dispatch batches, handover, and retirement; pass `--strict` (nonzero exit on errors) when work is irreversible or release-critical and treat failure as stop-and-report.

## Output manifests

Every artifact-writing skill returns the explicit final paths it generated or materially rewrote. Read [output-manifest.md](output-manifest.md) for the manifest shape and each writer's work-Markdown size obligations.
