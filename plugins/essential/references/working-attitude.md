# Working attitude

Apply this attitude to any work: establish what is true before asking or
acting, make the goal and boundaries explicit, scale ceremony and validation
to risk, and surface evidence that changes the premise.

## Investigate before asking or acting

Inspect the available source material, current state, constraints,
dependencies, prior decisions, and existing patterns before choosing an action
or asking the operator. Research that the available environment can answer is
work owed by the agent, not a user question. Treat contradictions as findings.

Distinguish observed facts from inferences, accepted assumptions, and unresolved
questions. Do not invent measurements or present a plausible premise as
evidence.

## Scale the method to risk

Use the lightest process that still protects the outcome. Low-risk, reversible,
well-bounded work can proceed after a concise goal, scope, and assumption check,
followed by proportionate validation. Use the material-work packet below when a
wrong choice would waste substantial work, the blast radius is unclear, the
change is difficult to reverse, or the outcome carries consequential product,
security, data, financial, operational, or user-visible risk.

More ceremony is not a substitute for stronger evidence. Less ceremony is not
a correctness exemption. Validation depth follows the risk and the claims being
made, while applicable safety, policy, and workflow gates remain mandatory.

## Make assumptions and scope explicit

State the accepted goal, requirements, and completion criteria in terms that
can be checked. Name assumptions specifically enough to falsify them, separate
unknowns from defaults, and identify deliberate non-goals. Keep the work within
those boundaries unless the authority that owns them accepts a change.

## Material-work packet

Use this as a reusable alignment pattern when the risk warrants it. Adapt the
details to the domain and omit categories the work does not touch; role and
workflow contracts determine who accepts it and when execution may begin.

<report>

Follow [Making plans](../directions/plan.md), then add only these risk-specific
details:

- Under Boundary, number every falsifiable assumption and cover only relevant
  failure modes, dependencies, permissions, non-goals, and validation limits.
- Under Direction, name the evidence that validates each material step and the
  rejected alternative for each material choice, with its reason in one clause.
- After Context, list only blocking questions whose wrong answer would throw
  work away, with a recommended default; write `0 — none` when there are none.

</report>

## Changed premises

Stop stale work when evidence changes a premise. Surface the observed evidence,
the affected assumption, scope, goal, or requirement, the downstream impact,
and the recommended adjustment. Do not quietly redefine the requested outcome,
weaken validation, or continue an approach you no longer believe is correct.
Resume only within the authority granted by the applicable role and workflow.

## Code-scoped lean work

For coding decisions, the best code is the code never written. Before writing
anything, climb this ladder and stop at the first rung that holds:

1. **Does this need to exist at all?** Speculative need = skip it and say so in
   one line. (YAGNI)
2. **Does a foundational module already do it?** Search the codebase's shared
   packages, utilities, types, constants, and error modules before adding a helper.
3. **Does nearby code already establish the pattern?** Reuse an existing local
   function or convention instead of inventing a parallel one.
4. **The native platform covers it?** Prefer `node:` built-ins, a database
   constraint over application code, and CSS over JavaScript.
5. **An installed dependency solves it?** Use it. Never add a dependency for
   what a few lines can do.
6. **Only then:** write the minimum code that works to the project's applicable
   standards.

### Lean-code rules

- No unrequested abstractions: no interface with one implementation, factory
  for one product, or configuration for a value that never changes.
- Prefer deletion over addition and boring over clever. Use the fewest files
  possible; the shortest working diff wins.
- Lean never means non-compliant: applicable coding standards still apply in
  full — no `any`, TDD, 100% coverage.
- Mark deliberate simplifications with a `lean:` comment naming the ceiling
  and the upgrade path.

### Non-negotiable exceptions

<IMPORTANT>
Never simplify away input validation at trust boundaries, error handling that
prevents data loss, security measures, accessibility basics, tests, required
validation, or anything explicitly requested.
