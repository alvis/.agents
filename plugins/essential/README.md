# Essential

The backbone every other plugin depends on. Essential owns the cross-plugin
**state lifecycle**: how work gets a durable identity, how its
state survives crashes and machine moves, how decisions and approvals stay
honest as reality changes, and how work retires without losing anything
consequential. It also carries the research/decision skills and the agent
installer.

## The contracts

Contracts load progressively — only the small `hooks/ALLAGENT.md`,
`hooks/MAINAGENT.md`, and `hooks/SUBAGENT.md` entry points are
injected, and once per session `hooks/STOP.md` blocks with a `.state`
reminder; everything else is read at the moment it matters.

| Reference | Read when | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references/state.md` | Before creating or rewriting any lifecycle-managed artifact | Topology (`docs/` + `.state/`), resolver/bootstrap, coordinator lease and write protocol, journal discipline, overviews, reviews, spec freshness, promotion, retirement |
| `references/state-format.md` | When writing or migrating a `state.md` | Task table shape, stable IDs, mark/status pairs, DAG and roll-ups, change control, journal grammar |
| `references/truth.md` | Once per work stream | Six kinds of truth, the five constitutional rules, validity, `capability_id` |
| `references/adr.md` | When creating, superseding, indexing, or reviewing an ADR | Current/archive paths, superseded header, current-only index, targeted history, integrity checks |
| `references/decision-causality.md` | When creating/accepting/superseding a decision | `supersedes`/`affects`/`invalidates`/`preserves`, blast-radius sweep, decision completion gate |
| `references/approvals.md` | When recording approvals or durable claims that age | The approval binding tuple, freshness metadata |
| `references/anchors.md` | For non-git anchors or cross-stream initiatives | Anchor declarations, adapter contract, initiative manifests |
| `references/lease.md` | Before coordinator writes | `ensure` choreography, the PM-only first-use bootstrap, the lease-verified write path, release moments |
| `references/overviews.md` | When reconciling lazy overviews | Proposals-vs-changes, child statuses, deviation provenance |
| `references/reviews.md` | When writing review artifacts | The seven review areas plus plugin-namespaced areas, finding lifecycle |
| `references/spec-lifecycle.md` | When materializing or revalidating specs | Mirrors, freshness sweep, completion verification |
| `references/durable-documentation.md` | Before writing versioned project documentation | Entrypoint authority, capability/domain content, template ownership, terminology, migration |
| `references/work-memory-topology.md` | When creating, locating, or migrating ignored work files | Commented `.state` file map |
| `references/change-control.md` | On a mid-execution finding | Task-local / plan-level / spec-level routing |
| `references/retirement.md` | When promoting, parking, or retiring | Promotion provenance, idle-stream parking, retirement gates |
| `references/team-lifecycle.md` | At spawn and wind-down moments | Team forming/retiring, model and effort selection |
| `references/directions/subagent-handover.md` | Before a first task handover | Required prompt fields, extensible Context, durable path compression, later-message boundary |

Templates: `templates/memory.md` (agent memory),
`templates/docs/*.template.md` (shared durable directory entrypoints), and
`templates/initiative-manifest.template.md` (Essential's initiative-domain
semantic authority). Domain plugins own their own semantic templates.

## The tools

- **`scripts/resolve-state-workspace`** — resolves the work identity and paths,
  enforces the `.state/` ignore gate and symlink/traversal safety, and
  performs the PM-only no-clobber bootstrap of `goal.md`, `state.md`,
  `state/working.md`, and `state/journal.md`.
- **`scripts/state-lease`** — the on-disk coordinator lease
  (`ensure | acquire | heartbeat | release | status | takeover`). The file
  stores only the token's SHA-256 digest, so reading it never confers the
  lease; exactly one live token may write coordinator-owned state; a live
  foreign lease is never replaced; an expired foreign lease yields only to
  an explicit, journaled takeover.
- **`scripts/state-write`** — the lease-verified write path: verifies
  the presented token, refuses free/expired/foreign leases, heartbeats, and
  applies the temp-write + atomic rename in one call, so a working
  coordinator can never expire its own lease by working.
- **`skills/doctor/scripts/state-doctor`** — read-only structural checker: duplicate or
  malformed task IDs, dangling dependencies, cycles, impossible roll-ups,
  contradictory mark/status pairs, missing evidence annotations, broken file
  references, unsuperseded decisions, ADR archive/index/integrity drift, stale
  leases, overview drift. Advisory by default; `--strict` for irreversible or
  release-critical moments. It never silently edits files.
- **`scripts/check-markdown-size`** — the 16,384-byte gate for work Markdown.

## Skills

| Skill | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| `essential:discover` | Finding material unknowns before planning: blindspot passes, brainstorms, interviews, reference extraction, disposable prototypes. |
| `essential:decide` | Choosing between researched approaches; records the approved decision with causal metadata and hands off to the owner. |
| `essential:deep-research` | Multi-source fact-finding with adversarial claim verification and citations. |
| `essential:autoresearch` | Metric-driven optimization loops (define metric → evolve candidates → verify → mutate). |
| `essential:handover` | Pausing work: persists all stream state, updates the global overview, releases leases. |
| `essential:takeover` | Resuming paused work from the on-disk work directories: checks leases, resolves blocking decisions, and drives streams to their success criteria. |
| `essential:doctor` | Health-checking `.state/`: runs the structural doctor, diagnoses format drift against the current contracts, and offers user-approved migration to the latest structure — judged by reading the contracts, never a version token. |
| `essential:handoff` | A zero-context cross-domain orchestration plan another agent can execute verbatim. |
| `essential:install-agents` | Installing/refreshing the stitched specialist agent roster into `~/.claude/agents/`. |
| `essential:install-output-styles` | Installing bundled Claude Code output styles into `~/.claude/output-styles/`. |
| `essential:install-statusline` | Installing the bundled Bullet Train statusline. |

## How state stays trustworthy

- **Append first, reconcile second.** Every transition lands in
  `state/journal.md` (with actor `capability_id`, `rev:<N>`, event type, and
  what it invalidates) before tables update; crash loss is bounded to one
  line.
- **One writer.** The lease holder alone writes `goal.md`, `state.md`,
  `state/*.md`, overviews, and `review.md`; workers return deltas.
- **Done stays done.** Invalidation marks `validity: stale` and spawns
  remediation tasks; history is never falsified.
- **`.state/` becomes disposable only after durable promotion and closure.**
  It is not byte-reconstructible. Decisions, approvals, artifact identities,
  unresolved risks, and reusable conclusions need durable carriers first; keep
  a copy of active work to guard against `git clean -fdx`.
