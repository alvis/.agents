# Promotion, parking, and retirement

Read this when promoting durable knowledge, parking an idle stream, or
retiring a completed one.

## Promotion

Promotion is auditable after retirement removes the work stream from the live
index: work closure requires a promotion receipt in the stream's final
`changes/` child listing every promoted path, or evidenced `not required` when
the stream produced no stable durable fact. Every promoted `docs/` file carries
front matter naming its `source-work` (the work ID), promotion date, and any
superseded document. Only stable knowledge is promoted — never transient task
state. Durable docs that can age may carry the freshness metadata in
[approvals.md](../references/approvals.md).

## Parking idle streams

Live streams are not free: the journal grows, `../references/state.md` accumulates rows,
and every session re-reads them. A stream idle long past its last journal
entry — abandoned rather than paused — may be **parked**: move its entire
`works/<work-id>/` directory to `.state/archive/<work-id>/`, the single sink
for every stream that leaves `works/`, which the
resolver never enumerates, and drop or annotate its `overview.md` row. Both
paths are under the default source tree's `.state/` — the only tree that
carries one — so parking is a move within one directory, never across trees. Park
only with user approval, journal the parking as the final line first, and
never park a stream holding an unresolved critical risk or an unpublished
accepted decision — resolve, promote, or hand over those first. Unparking
is a plain move back. A summary journal line may also compact history: it
may summarize and supersede the journal lines before it, keeping live
streams readable without losing the record (the superseded lines remain,
marked by the summary above them).

## Completion and the debt rule

These steps are ordered, because two of them are crash-unsafe reversed.

1. **The completion receipt is written first.** Phase `completed` requires it
   ([state-format.md](../references/state-format.md)); everything below
   reads from it rather than from the overview row it is about to drop.
2. **Every outlives-me item has an owner, or the stream does not complete.**
   A follow-up left in a row that will be deleted in days, held by nobody, is
   a plan to forget it. Promote it to `docs/`, open a successor stream, or
   file it in the tracker — then name that carrier in the receipt.
3. **Landing evidence is recorded and elapsed idle time never substitutes for
   it.** Coding work records a merged pull request, merge SHA, or observation on
   the default branch. Non-coding work records explicit acceptance and every
   promotion receipt (paths or evidenced `not required`). A stream marked `completed` without its applicable
   evidence has demonstrated nothing; retiring it because it has sat still
   converts *"nobody recorded why this finished"* into *"this finished"*, and
   files that upgrade in the one place nobody re-reads. Absence of evidence
   fails toward the finding: the stream stays in `works/`, and its `Next
   action` names the missing locator.
4. **A `completed` stream at `Blocked on: <named blocker>` does not archive.**
   The condition is landing evidence **and** no open question, because `archive/`
   is skipped by the resolver — archiving a stream that still carries an
   operator question drops that question out of the overview's `Awaiting you`
   section, burying precisely what that section exists to surface. Landing
   evidence retires the work; it does not answer the question. The stream holds
   its place at phase `completed` until the question is answered, or until its
   answer is owned by a carrier that outlives the stream (step 2).
   `Blocked on: unknown` names no question, so archiving drops nothing out of
   `Awaiting you` and nothing holds the stream: it is an ordinary stream
   overdue for retention under step 5.
5. **Three days after landing evidence, move `works/<work-id>/` to
   `archive/<work-id>/` first, then drop the overview row.** Three days is long
   enough for whoever was watching the merge to see it settle, and short enough
   that the table indexes live work. The order is not negotiable: while the
   stream sits in `works/` the overview row is its only index, so dropping the
   row first hides live work, and a crash between the two steps loses it
   entirely. The stream then appears in `Recently landed` until that section's
   cap retires the line, and in `archive/` permanently — nothing deletes an archived stream,
   which is what keeps its ID from being reused.

## Retirement

Retire completed local work only after its applicable landing evidence, review
closure, durable promotion or evidenced `not required`, final receipts, and every accepted
decision's disposition under the completion gate
([decision-causality.md](../references/decision-causality.md)) are recorded. A Notion push,
verification pull, and zero-diff receipt are required only for Notion-backed
work. Coding landing evidence is a merged pull request, merge SHA, or
default-branch observation; non-coding landing evidence is explicit acceptance
plus the promotion receipt. Retirement moves
the operational projection into `.state/archive/`, permanently: no skill
deletes archived streams. Existing ambiguous artifacts are reported and
preserved, never migrated by guesswork.

A retired stream's own `archive/<work-id>/state.md` is the permanent home for
its identity and outcome, whatever the stream had worth promoting — code-only
work leaves no separate durable document to carry its name. Its tracking state
does not alter that contract: never delete the archived record, committed or
uncommitted.
