description: Create a new responsive screen-design contract from user-selected product and specification context, keep temporary exploration in the active work item, synchronize approved content through an explicitly selected body author and Notion transport, and promote durable design docs. Route existing screens to update-screen-design.

# Create Screen Design

Create new screen design without conflating ignored Notion transport, task-specific design exploration, and durable versioned design knowledge.

## Boundaries

- Use for new UX contracts, layouts, responsive behavior, interaction states, accessibility, and handoff notes. Existing pages route to `update-screen-design`; implementation/rendered review stays with Web owners.
- Temporary detail lives in `.state/works/<work-id>/design/<slug>.md`; `design.md` is the main-agent-owned overview. Do not create an independent design artifact elsewhere.
- Notion transport bodies are opaque here. This plugin ships no body grammar or body-authoring skill. Before semantic body creation or change, require the exact external `--body-author=<plugin:skill>` selected by the caller and pass it unchanged through the selected transport operation. Do not choose/derive filenames or size-gate transport files.
- Durable feature/screen design promotes to `docs/design/<slug>.md`; only truly system-wide tokens/components/states/motion/accessibility update `docs/design/system.md` or its children.
- Only the main agent writes work state, durable documents, or the external design authority. A delegated run may read sources and return proposed child, body, document, and reconciliation content; it stops before mutation.

## Inputs

- **Required**: product and screen descriptions.
- **Optional**: work id, constraints, platforms (default web + mobile), and an explicit context source, materialization direction, local transport root, and transport profile.
- **Required for a Notion-backed creation**: explicit template, parent, and collection refs plus one canonical `--body-author=<plugin:skill>` matching `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*:[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$` and an absolute transport profile. This marketplace supplies no defaults.
- **Prerequisites**: resolvable product/context, Notion credentials/tooling, and an active work stream.

For a direct main-agent run, follow `essential:directions/establish-work-stream.md`: preserve an explicit user Work-ID override; otherwise select or derive the identity contextually, reuse a candidate only when its charter already owns the requested outcome, and rerun the resolver with the selected ID after `work_id_required`. Never ask the user merely to approve an identifier. A delegated run receives the resolved Work ID/root; if it encounters `work_id_required` instead, return the resolver payload to the main agent without asking the user.

## Workflow

1. Before creating or materially rewriting a project artifact, read the absolute `state.md` path injected by Essential. If unavailable, stop artifact writes and report the missing contract. Use the workspace resolver result as the active work root. Read only the work pointers and spec/design sources required for this screen-design assignment.
2. Materialize required product/spec context from the source, location, and direction supplied by the user or active work state. Use local or inline context directly. For a remote source, invoke `specification:sync-notion` in `notion-to-local` mode with the explicit transport profile and preserve every returned path and ref. Never assume a synchronization skill, body author, template/parent/collection ref, default mirror, or fixed transport directory. Pull the caller-selected live screen template into the explicitly selected transport root. Search for collisions; existing screens route to update.
3. Map each requested screen to product relation, source refs, constraints, and platform coverage. Prepare a lowercase work-local design child with purpose, audience/task, hierarchy/navigation, responsive behavior, loading/empty/ error states, accessibility, distinct alternatives/rationale, decisions, implementation notes, and provenance.
4. Present alternatives and obtain approval. Return the child and row/status to the main agent, which alone writes it and reconciles `design.md`/`state.md`.
5. The main agent alone performs this step. For each approved screen, require an explicit local unsynced transport path from the caller or selected transport; never synthesize it from the title or id. Resolve and validate `body_author` once, record `selection_source: explicit_argument|delegated_caller`, and invoke that exact capability only with the approved body and exact path. Apply the explicitly supplied template, parent, and collection refs without substituting a built-in value. Then invoke `specification:sync-notion` in `local-to-notion` mode with the exact transport profile and identical body-author selector. Accept the canonical ref only from the validated create output, then verification-pull that identity into staging. Only after the staged identity and body match may `specification:sync-notion` advance the canonical local metadata and receipt. Never expect an external executable to rewrite the source file in place. Verify the unchanged selector before attempting another screen.
6. The main agent promotes stable non-system design to `docs/design/<screen-slug>.md` with Notion ids, source revision/hash, approved decision links, and supersession metadata. Route any system-wide rules to `docs/design/system.md` without duplicating them in the screen doc. Read `${ESSENTIAL_ROOT}/templates/docs/readme.md` and `${ESSENTIAL_ROOT}/templates/docs/design.md`, using the root derived from the injected state contract, then update `docs/README.md` and `docs/design/README.md` links when needed.
7. Verify each remote page through the selected transport's diff or verification pull into an explicit verification location, and verify the durable derivation against that source. Stop on uncertain creation to avoid duplicates.
8. While writing eligible work Markdown, the owning main agent follows `essential:references/output-manifest.md`, including splitting an oversized file before return. Return explicit final paths generated or materially rewritten as `generated_files`, plus main-agent reconciliation.

## Verification

- Each screen has one unambiguous remote ref with canonical parent/product relations and complete responsive/state/accessibility coverage.
- Work design remains temporary and lower-case; durable promotion is approved, versioned, linked, and provenance-backed.
- No transport path was invented or body-edited outside the explicitly selected body-author capability; no subagent edited main-agent-owned files.
- `generated_files` includes every work/durable/transport path changed.

## Completion

Return status, caller-supplied template/parent/collection refs, body-author capability and selection source, work/spec sources, per-screen temporary design, remote ref/verification, durable promotion/system-rule routing, main-agent reconciliation, unattempted recovery, and `generated_files`.
