# Canonical review rendering

<report>

Render actionable Markdown from `<audit-dir>/report-final.json`, or from `report.json` with explicit partial coverage when manual adjudication is not complete. Raw data remains evidence; canonical work review files are the human engineering interface.

## Source validation

Before rendering:

1. Require contract version `3.0` and retain the source path plus SHA-256.
2. Preserve audited URLs, exact viewport dimensions, CLI exit status, warnings, capped/unvisited pages, cross-origin exclusions, orphan routes, recurring elements, crop/context paths, and manual-review coverage.
3. Verify every final AI verdict cites a focused crop or records `missing_section_crop` with null verdict.
4. Build one stable Web source key from the CLI finding ID when present, otherwise `<rule-id>--<route-hash8>--<selector-hash8>`. This key locates the existing canonical `<PREFIX>-P<n>-<seq>` ID; it is not itself the Markdown finding ID.

## Classification and reconciliation

Apply `review-template.md` and classify each finding exactly once. Map `critical|high|medium|low` to `P0|P1|P2|P3`; retain `info` as advisory raw evidence without a canonical priority ID unless stronger evidence raises its severity. Group actionable findings by canonical review area, then priority and stable source key. Before allocating an ID, load the applicable existing area file and reuse the canonical ID already paired with that source key. Allocate only genuinely new IDs using the area's canonical prefix and its next unused sequence. Never renumber old IDs or use raw CLI IDs as headings.

Return complete proposed content only for applicable `reviews/<area>.md` files. The main agent writes them. Each proposal must retain the canonical frontmatter, verdict line, required finding fields, and existing findings not owned by this Web run. Merge by source key so a rerun updates evidence without erasing dispositions, owners, recheck conditions, risk acceptance, or findings from other reviewers. Recompute the file's five disposition counts, derived closed/outstanding counts, outstanding P0-P3 counts, and verdict from the entire resulting file.

Coverage defects are findings in `testing.md`, including:

- zero audited pages or capped/unvisited required pages;
- missing required viewport/state data;
- missing focused crop for AI adjudication;
- driver warnings that invalidate claimed coverage; and
- incomplete manual review.

Site-level navigation or interaction failures belong to `correctness.md`. Recurring visual issues are one `quality.md` finding with all affected routes, not duplicate per-page prose. Cross-origin candidates declined by the user are recorded as scope evidence, not defects.

## Main-agent roll-up handoff

Validate every proposed area against `review-template.md`, then return its reconciliation payload. For each area, report all five dispositions, derived closed/outstanding counts, P0-P3 counts, verdict, and path. An absent area is `not_run` with zeroes unless an existing canonical area file supplies current counts; it is never silently reported as `pass` or `skipped`. Add:

```yaml
audit_summary:
  overall_score: <exact CLI value>
  risk: critical|high|medium|low
  pages_audited: <n>
  viewports: [<label + dimensions>]
  worst_pages: [<URL + score + primary finding IDs>]
  warnings: [<exact warnings>]
  raw_evidence: [<absolute final paths>]
```

This payload is for main-agent reconciliation into area files and `review.md`; a worker writes neither. Conversation output is a concise status, top open findings, temporary evidence paths, and coverage limitations.

## Multi-page audits

Keep per-page and per-viewport data in JSON. Canonical findings cite every affected page. Sort the concise handoff's worst pages from lowest score upward, but retain all details in source evidence and review findings.
