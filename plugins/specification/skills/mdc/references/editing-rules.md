# Editing Rules

Catalogue of safe vs risky operations on MDC files, with the invariant checklist the skill applies after every edit. Loaded by the skill in `edit` mode.

## 1. Operation Catalogue

### Safe Operations (apply directly)

| Operation                       | What it changes                                       | Notes                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Update an annotation value      | one key in `{{ … }}`                                  | leave key order and other keys untouched                                                       |
| Add a key to an annotation      | append `, key: value` before the closing `}}`         | check it still parses as YAML                                                                  |
| Remove a key from an annotation | drop the key and its leading/trailing comma           | mind comma cleanup — no `, ,` or trailing `,`                                                 |
| Replace block textual content   | the content line(s) of one block, same type           | keep indent identical; preserve annotation adjacency                                            |
| Append a child block            | insert child after parent's last existing child       | child indent = parent indent + 2 spaces; add a closing marker if parent gains its first child  |
| Add a `ref:` to a block         | inject `{{ ref: <id> }}` above an unannotated block   | no blank line between the new annotation and the block                                         |
| Add an inline annotation        | wrap a span as `[span]{{ … }}`                        | no whitespace between `]` and `{{`                                                              |
| Update author-owned front-matter scalar | one non-transport key in the YAML head              | preserve indentation; never edit `ref`, `parent`, `last_edited_time`, or another transport-owned key |

### Risky Operations (CONFIRM with user before applying)

| Operation                            | Why risky                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Move a block under a new parent      | every descendant must be re-indented; any closing markers in the subtree must follow.      |
| Delete a block that has children     | losing descendants is rarely intended; confirm scope.                                      |
| Change a block's inferred type       | e.g. `- item` → `## heading` reshapes the AST; consequences for siblings may surprise.     |
| Rename a `ref:` that appears elsewhere | refs are the addressing primitive — cross-references and diff identity rely on them.     |
| Bulk re-indent                       | easy to break adjacency or split children from parents.                                    |
| Convert plain Markdown → MDC         | out of scope for v1; reject and direct user to author from spec.                           |

For each risky operation, present a one-line plan back to the user and wait for confirmation before using the filesystem edit capability.

## 2. Invariant Checklist (run after EVERY edit)

The skill MUST reread the modified region through the filesystem read capability and check each item. Failure on any item → fix before yielding.

1. **Indent multiple of 2 spaces** on every modified line; no tabs introduced.
2. **Annotation adjacency**: every `{{ … }}` block annotation is followed on the next line by its target block. No blank line between them.
3. **YAML inside `{{ … }}` parses**: commas separate keys, quotes balanced, no stray `:` or unmatched brackets.
4. **YAML in front matter parses** (if touched).
5. **Inline annotation adjacency**: every `]` or `)` that should carry a `{{ … }}` has the `{{` immediately after, no whitespace.
6. **Closing marker integrity** (see `references/syntax.md` from the skill root):
   - every existing marker preserved unless its block lost its last child;
   - every newly ref'd-with-children block has a matching marker added;
   - every marker's `ref` matches its opening block's `ref`;
   - every marker's indent matches its opening block's indent.
7. **Escapes intact**: any `\{\{`, `\}\}`, `\[`, `\]`, `\\` outside fenced code blocks is still escaped.
8. **No accidental fence change**: a triple-backtick line you didn't intend to touch is still a triple-backtick line.
9. **Transport metadata unchanged**: compare the pre-edit capture of `ref`,
   `parent`, and `last_edited_time` with the final frontmatter. Local authoring
   never synthesizes or updates remote revision metadata.

## 3. Recovery Moves

When a verification check fails, prefer minimal repair over rewrite.

| Symptom                                           | Recovery                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blank line introduced between annotation and block | Remove the blank line (single-line delete).                                                       |
| Annotation YAML now invalid (stray comma, etc.)  | Edit only the corrected `{{ … }}`; do not touch surrounding lines.                                |
| Marker `ref` no longer matches opening            | Update the marker (not the opening); the opening's `ref` is the source of truth.                  |
| Marker indent off                                 | Re-indent the marker line to match the opening's indent with a leading-whitespace-only edit.       |
| Child indent off after move                       | Re-indent the moved subtree; markers in the subtree must shift by the same amount.                |
| Inline annotation drifted from its `]`           | Close the gap: `] {{ ` → `]{{ `.                                                                  |
| Front-matter YAML invalid                         | Restore the prior front matter from the pre-edit Read; reapply the intended scalar change.        |

If a single repair fails twice, **stop and report** rather than escalating edits — the file may be in a state that needs a human or the `@theriety/mdc` runtime to diagnose.

## 4. Procedural Pattern for a Generic Edit

```
1. Detect mode (edit) and load `references/syntax.md` plus this file.
2. Grep -n for `ref:\s*<TARGET>` or for the opening line of the block.
3. Read the file around the match (≥5 lines before, ≥10 after) and capture
   transport-owned frontmatter before mutation.
4. Plan the smallest Edit: which old_string, which new_string.
   - If risky per §1, surface the plan to the user first.
5. Issue the Edit.
6. Re-Read the modified region.
7. Run the §2 checklist.
8. If anything fails, apply a single recovery move from §3 and re-verify (max 2 attempts).
9. Report (mode, file, refs touched, marker changes, invariants verified).
```

## 5. Working in engineering specification roots

Notion-backed MDC may live at an exact caller-supplied or transport-returned
mirror path, or in the active work's selected specification materialization.
The mirror location is a project/user choice rather than a workspace-resolver
output. Transport and temporary work state remain distinct, and sync and
completion stay separate operations owned by `specification:sync-notion` and
`specification:sync-spec`.

Two things require special care:

- The root spec file, identified by frontmatter `ref:` and the materialization
  receipt rather than its filename, MUST remain non-empty.
- Front-matter `ref:` is the page's Notion ID. Never edit it unless explicitly told to.
- Front-matter `last_edited_time` is Notion transport's remote revision
  evidence. Never stamp it with the local clock, even after a body edit. Omit
  it for an unsynced locally authored page until transport returns a value, and
  record local edit timing only in the work evidence or receipt.

Never derive or rename a file from its title or `ref:`. MDC paths are owned by
notion-sync and are not subject to the ordinary Markdown byte gate.
