# GIT-PR-SIZE-02: Yellow Zone PR Size

## Severity

warning

## Intent

A yellow-zone PR changes **≤ 30 files** AND has **≤ 1200 authored net LOC** while exceeding green thresholds. File count includes generated paths; LOC excludes their additions and deletions under `GIT-PR-SIZE-01`.

The canonical PR template owns the additional Risk and Test plan evidence required for this zone. Human verification tasks are generated after AI review and hosted CI pass.

The limits above are a human-readable projection of `../../../skills/pr/assets/size-thresholds.json`, the sole numeric threshold authority, and contract verification checks them against that asset.

## Fix

Author the PR body through the canonical template and supply its yellow-zone evidence from the change; do not publish size counts or zone bookkeeping.

### Why this matters

- A yellow PR is large enough that "looks right" is not enough — the reviewer needs the author's mental model.
- Risk plus Test plan converts implicit confidence into explicit, reviewable claims.
- Yellow is a healthy zone: do not artificially shrink to green if the change is genuinely cohesive.

## Edge Cases

- Generated output can lower the LOC zone, but never the file-count zone. The Risk section remains required whenever either authored LOC or all-path file count places the PR in yellow.
- Yellow PRs that mix migration and logic must be split (`GIT-PR-TYPE-03`); an isolated atomic migration keeps its actual size zone.
- Repository configuration cannot move the asset-defined band.
