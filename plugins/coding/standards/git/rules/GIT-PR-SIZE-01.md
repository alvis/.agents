# GIT-PR-SIZE-01: Green Zone PR Size

## Severity

warning

## Intent

A green-zone PR changes **≤ 15 files** AND has **≤ 500 authored net LOC**.
Green PRs are the default-mergeable unit of work — small enough that a
reviewer can hold the entire diff in their head, fast enough that turnaround
does not stall a stack.

A PR's zone is the stricter of the two metrics: 12 files / 600 authored net
LOC is yellow, not green. Every changed path counts toward the file metric.
Exclude additions and deletions from generated files from the authored net LOC
metric.

The limits above are a human-readable projection of
`../../../skills/pr/assets/size-thresholds.json`, the sole numeric threshold
authority, and contract verification checks them against that asset.

## Fix

Run `bun run ../../../skills/pr/scripts/classify-pr-size.ts` against the
exact base/head pair, then author the body through the canonical PR template.
Do not add file counts, LOC, or zone bookkeeping to the PR body.

### Why this matters

- Reviewer working memory is the binding constraint, not LOC alone.
- Green PR body requirements are owned by the canonical PR template (`GIT-PR-02`).
- Stacks are healthier when each layer fits in green — splits become natural, not forced.

## Edge Cases

- Package lockfiles such as `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and paths marked
  `linguist-generated=true`, contribute no LOC but still count as changed
  files. Mark them per `GIT-PR-TYPE-05` so reviewers know their generator.
- Tests count toward LOC. A green-LOC PR with a 400-line test file is still green; do not split tests away from the code they cover.
- A generated file not covered by the classifier's deterministic lockfile or
  Git-attribute contract remains authored for LOC sizing.
- Uncommitted `.git/info/attributes`, global/system attributes, and external
  diff configuration never classify a path or change its line count; only the
  committed base/head inputs do.
