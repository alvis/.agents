# DOC-CONT-05: No Standard Rule IDs in Comments

## Intent

Source-code comments must not reference standard rule IDs (`DOC-FORM-03`, `TYP-IMPT-07`, `RPS-LAYOUT-01`) or group prefixes (`TST-STRU`, `RC-DOC`). Rule IDs are scaffolding for the standards system — lookup keys in rule files, lint reports, and PR review prose — not explanations of WHY the code is shaped a certain way. Comments must describe intent in their own terms.

## Fix

Replace the rule reference with the underlying reason:

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: leaks tooling vocabulary into the source file
// ensure first letter is lowercase per DOC-FORM-03
const summary = lowercaseFirst(text);

// ✅ GOOD: state the intent
// JSDoc summaries are sentence fragments that read together with the type signature
const summary = lowercaseFirst(text);
```

## Allowed Cases

The advisory scanner flags every match; humans triage. Permitted exceptions (not auto-suppressed):

- **Standards-enforcement tooling** — audit/lint scripts whose code section literally implements the named rule may annotate the section in a header comment (e.g., `// ---- Color collection (DES-CONS-01) ----` in `web:scripts/audits/design-tokens-audit.js`). The rule ID identifies the artifact under test, not the reason for the code.

## Edge Cases

- Section headers like `// --- IDENTIFIERS --- //` are governed by `DOC-FORM-06`, not this rule, even though the token shape superficially resembles a rule ID.
- String literals embedding a rule ID (e.g., `const id = "TST-STRU-01"`) are not comments and are not in scope.
- TODO/REVIEW tags pinned to a rule (`// TODO: align with TYP-IMPT-07`) are governed by `DOC-LIFE-01` / `DOC-LIFE-02` — remove the tag first; the rule-ID violation falls out automatically.
