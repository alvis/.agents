# Publishing the review to GitHub

Load this from the *Publish the review* step of `coding:pr review`.

Submit body, verdict, and every inline comment in one `POST`. The create-pending /
add-comments / submit sequence leaves a half-populated pending review on the PR when
any step fails, and a pending review is invisible to the author but blocks the next
run.

Render every `comments[].body` through
[inline-review.md](../templates/inline-review.md).

```bash
gh api --hostname "$HOST" --method POST \
  "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/reviews" --input "$REVIEW_PAYLOAD"
```

## Payload

```json
{
  "commit_id": "<the pinned HEAD_OID>",
  "body": "<overall review, from ../templates/overall-review.md>",
  "event": "REQUEST_CHANGES | APPROVE | COMMENT",
  "comments": [
    { "path": "src/auth/session.ts", "line": 42, "side": "RIGHT", "body": "<rendered inline-review.md>" },
    { "path": "src/auth/session.ts", "start_line": 51, "line": 58, "side": "RIGHT", "body": "<rendered inline-review.md>" }
  ]
}
```

- [review-tone.md](review-tone.md) selects each marker's meaning;
  [inline-review.md](../templates/inline-review.md) is the only owner of its
  markup and comment shape.
- `commit_id` is mandatory here even though the API treats it as optional. Without
  it GitHub anchors against the current head, so a push mid-review silently
  relocates every comment.
- Immediately before assembling this payload, re-read `headRefOid`, `baseRefName`,
  and `baseRefOid` for the PR. A stacked review re-reads and compares those three
  values for every `PR_SURFACES` entry. If any value differs from its pinned
  capsule, stop before writing or submitting the payload and return a concurrency
  blocker; never publish against a moved head or base.
- For a black-zone `APPROVE`, the review workflow must also run
  `scripts/verify-black-zone-authorization.sh` immediately before payload
  assembly against those same live head/base OIDs. Parse its compact JSON
  receipt and require `comment_url`, `comment_id`, `comment_node_id`,
  `author_login`, `head_oid`, `base_oid`, `authorization_body`, and the three
  `rationale` strings. Use `authorization_body` and `rationale` as the sole semantic authorization-review input;
  never substitute an earlier fetched
  comment or body. Missing authorization or an invalid receipt caps the event
  at `COMMENT`; it does not prevent `REQUEST_CHANGES`.
- `line` is the line number in the file at `commit_id`, not a diff offset.
- `start_line` must be below `line` on the same `side`.

Assemble the file with `jq` and shell redirection into the review tree. Comment
bodies carry newlines, backticks, and code fences, so string-concatenated JSON breaks
on the first one — and a file-writing capability is denied by this agent's filesystem write/edit
fence.

## Failure recovery

| Response | Cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 422 naming a comment path or line | The line is not in the diff | Drop that comment, null its anchoring fields, set `subject` to its path, and re-render it from the finding into the overall body. Resubmit once. |
| 422 on `APPROVE`/`REQUEST_CHANGES` | Self-review | Resubmit with `COMMENT`; state the downgrade in the body. |

Recovery moves the raw finding's `title` and `body`, never the rendered comment.
The inline body already opens with its marker, and the overall body's bullet
prepends one of its own, so relocating the posted text verbatim would ship two
markers on one finding and break the exactly-one rule in
[review-tone.md](review-tone.md).

Never answer a 422 by re-anchoring the comment to a nearby line that happens to be
in the diff. A comment on the wrong line costs more author time than no comment.

## Re-review hygiene

- Skip a finding whose path, line, and substance already appear in
  `gh api --hostname "$HOST" repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments`.
  The author has seen it.
- Re-evaluate every existing unresolved P0/P1/P2 thread against the pinned head
  and return `still_applies`, `fixed`, or `does_not_apply` in completion. Do not
  repost it.
- When a previously reported issue's latest verdict differs from its verdict in the
  immediately preceding review, add one line under `### 🔄 Previous reports` that
  links the original report and summarizes the latest verdict and changed evidence.
  Omit the section when no prior issue changed verdict, and do not repeat unchanged
  issues. A fixed issue remains an overall-body line rather than a new inline comment.
- For each unresolved inline thread, inspect the pinned head for related changes.
  When the concern is addressed, post a concise confirmation reply only if no
  existing reply records the work, then resolve the thread. Never resolve a concern
  that still applies, and never duplicate an existing implementation reply.
