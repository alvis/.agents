description: Improve green code through behavior-preserving structural changes to organization, naming, readability, documentation, or redundant defensive logic. Use to remove meaningless helpers or internal runtime checks when existing tests pass and the requested outcome is maintainability rather than changed behavior.

# Refactor Code

Before any `jj` decision or command, follow
`coding:directions/jj.md`.

Improve green code's structure, readability, naming, and documentation
without changing behavior, keeping every test passing throughout.
`coding:fix` owns failing code; `coding:write-code` owns new functionality;
`coding:modernize` owns version-driven API upgrades.

<IMPORTANT>
Coherence Mandate: every edit must produce one continuous, deliberate work —
rewrite over restructure, restructure over integrate, never append. A reader
must not be able to tell which parts are new. That standard is why
refactoring exists: it absorbs earlier compromises into the current shape of
the code rather than layering niceties on top — and the Two-Stage Rule in
step 2 is its concrete application to file size.
</IMPORTANT>

## Boundaries

- Use for: behavior-preserving improvements to structure, complexity,
  naming, readability, redundant helpers or defensive checks, JSDoc, and
  inline documentation on code whose tests pass. Supported behavior must stay
  unchanged; typed-contract violations by closed first-party implementations
  are not supported behavior.
- Do not use for: new features or business logic (`coding:write-code`),
  fixing bugs or failing tests (`coding:fix`), creating new test cases, or
  modifying project configuration. Reject when tests fail in the target area
  (fix first) or the area path resolves to no files.

## Inputs

- **Required**: `area` — path to the code to refactor.
- **Optional**: `--focus=naming|structure|redundancy|docs|all` (default `all`);
  `--from-composite` when invoked from a composite workflow.
- **Prerequisites**: all tests in the target area pass.

## Standards

Select `universal`, `typescript`, `function`, `documentation`, and `naming`,
plus `file-structure` when creating or moving files. Before editing, read only
each selected standard's `meta.md`. After editing, apply its `scan.md`; when
the scan identifies a violation, read the matching
`rules/<lowercase-rule-id>.md` guide when present. If that standard has no
matching per-rule guide, read its `write.md` as the bounded fallback. Correct
the violation and rerun the affected scan.

## Workflow

1. **Analyze.** Parse the area and `--focus`. Run the existing tests; if any
   fail, reject and direct to `coding:fix`. Read the target files and list
   opportunities: structural improvements (extract functions, reduce
   complexity), readability enhancements, naming violations, missing or
   incomplete JSDoc, inline-comment gaps on complex logic, inconsistencies
   with established codebase patterns, and redundancy candidates. For
   redundancy, search for validate/assert/check/ensure helpers, schema parses,
   catch-and-translate blocks, and guards immediately after internal calls;
   these are candidates, not violations.
2. **Restructure** (focus `structure` or `all`). Apply design patterns per
   the standards, reduce function complexity, extract reusable helpers, and
   run tests continuously so no functionality breaks. When a file exceeds the
   project's `max-lines` threshold, apply the Two-Stage Rule before any
   ad-hoc split: Stage 1 — extract logic into another file as a genuinely
   reusable helper, preferred when more than one caller shares it; Stage 2 —
   if still over the threshold, split into the `<base>.ts` + `<base>/*.ts`
   folder pattern, keeping `<base>.ts` as a thin re-export/orchestrator and
   moving helpers into `<base>/*.ts` with short names (the folder provides
   the context). Never split into arbitrary sibling files (e.g.
   `foo.schema.ts`, `foo.parse.ts`) unless that naming is already an
   established project convention. The full rule and examples live in the
   coding plugin's `standards/file-structure/` under "Long-File Decomposition."
3. **Remove redundancy** (focus `redundancy` or `all`). For every candidate,
   trace all producers, callers, registration paths, dynamic loading, unsafe
   casts, and external inputs. Apply `GEN-SAFE-03`'s decision test. Retain
   guards at real trust boundaries and for conditions supported execution can
   invalidate independently. When a check only reasserts a postcondition of
   closed, typed, tested first-party code—even one the type cannot fully
   express—locate and cite the exact producer test for that postcondition, then
   remove the check and any helper, import, error mapping, or test made
   unreachable. Broad producer coverage is insufficient. If provenance is
   ambiguous or the exact test is absent, report the site without editing it;
   route missing producer coverage to `coding:complete-test` before retrying.
4. **Improve readability** (focus `naming` or `all`). Apply naming standards
   to variables, functions, and files; simplify complex expressions; improve
   flow and logical grouping; remove dead code and unnecessary comments.
5. **Document** (focus `docs` or `all`). Add JSDoc for all public functions,
   classes, and interfaces — parameters, returns, behavior, and `@example`
   blocks where appropriate — and inline comments that explain why, not what;
   mark known limitations with TODO/FIXME.
6. **Validate.** Run focused tests after each redundancy removal, then the full
   test suite with coverage, the linter, and the
   type checker. When a check fails, fix the cause and re-run that check;
   repeat until every check passes or a concrete blocker remains, then report
   the blocker instead of looping.

## Verification

- All tests pass with coverage maintained at its prior level; behavior is
  unchanged.
- Lint and type checks pass.
- Every removed runtime check has recorded producer provenance; no public,
  external, dynamic, unsafe, persistence, or deserialization path reaches it,
  and supported execution cannot invalidate the condition independently.
- Every removed producer postcondition check cites the existing test path and
  test name that proves that exact postcondition.
- Public APIs in the area carry complete JSDoc, and no file exceeds
  `max-lines` without a recorded blocker.

## Completion

Report the area and focus, files refactored, improvements applied with
file:line entries, retained and removed redundancy candidates with trust-boundary
rationale and exact producer-test evidence, JSDoc blocks added, naming fixes,
and quality-gate results (tests, coverage, types, lint). Suggest commit via `coding:commit`
when relevant. A partial result names the failing check and the blocker.
