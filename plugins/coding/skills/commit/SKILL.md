# Save Any Code Change — jj-first, git-compatible

Before any `jj` decision or command, follow
`coding:directions/jj.md`.

Before any script call, set `CODING_COMMIT_SKILL_DIR` to the absolute directory
containing this loaded `SKILL.md`. This works in all three harnesses; not every harness exposes a plugin-root
variable to ordinary shell calls.

This skill is the single entrypoint for saving work: local snapshots, edits to prior changes, splits, reorders, parallel tasks, the two exceptional direct-bookmark sync routes, and the compatibility route from `--create-pr` to `coding:pr create`. It auto-routes based on working-copy state; flags exist only for explicit operations and behavioural overrides. It is the sole owner of history mutations — `coding:finalize-commits` verifies stacks, and `coding:pr create` authors PR text, owns PR publication, and drives CI convergence.

This skill owns commit, branch, and local-history directions. The PR action
references own publication directions; `coding:standards/git/` separately owns
findings in rendered PR messages and implementation diffs.

**Coherence Mandate.** Every edit must produce one continuous, deliberate work. Rewrite over restructure, restructure over integrate, never append. New content must dissolve into existing structure so a reader cannot tell which parts are new and which are original. Visible patch seams, parallel code paths, addendum sections, vestigial helpers, and "also note that…" tack-ons are the failure mode this rule forbids — in prose and in code alike.

## Commit and branch directions

Inspect the working tree, branch or bookmark graph, remote refs, and open PRs
before mutation. Plan domain-coherent changes that compile, pass applicable tests, and remain
reviewable without forward references; preserve unrelated dirty paths.

Use lowercase kebab-case branch segments. An ordinary branch is
`<type>/<kebab-summary>`; preserve an established `<type>/<scope>/<topic>`
shape when the repository uses scoped branches. A work stream uses exactly the
single-PR or numbered-stack shape from `essential:references/naming.md`; its
work ID is an identity, not a commit scope. Delete merged branches.

Never rewrite a commit already merged into a shared destination. Fix merged
work with a corrective commit or PR. Rewriting a merged non-destination branch
requires explicit user consent and coordination; rewriting the shared
destination tip is forbidden. Route an unmerged stack fix to the earliest
change that owns the faulty artifact, then return the rewritten stack metadata
to the caller that owns any subsequent `coding:pr update`.

## Boundaries

- Use for: committing or describing changes, saving an exact lifecycle-owned
  path set while preserving unrelated dirty work, splitting mixed work, editing
  prior changes, retrospective blame fixups, reordering history, parallel
  workspaces, direct bookmark sync for the correct-merged and
  partial-to-branch routes, and preserving the `--create-pr` compatibility
  entrypoint.
- Do not use for: composing PR titles or bodies, general remote publication, or opening, updating, and polling PRs (`coding:pr create`), per-commit QA of an unpushed stack (`coding:finalize-commits`), or diagnosing code failures (`coding:fix`).
- Tool precedence, functional colocation, initialization, workspace use, and
  command selection come from `coding:directions/jj.md`.
  This skill applies that policy to the selected save route; `coding:pr`
  remains the publication owner.

<IMPORTANT>
- Every workflow MUST end with a linear clean chain + working code. No exceptions. If a workflow cannot guarantee this, STOP and surface to the user.
- This skill never opens, updates, or polls PRs. Its only pushes are the explicit, single-bookmark sync steps in `directions/merged.md` Option 2 and `directions/partial.md`; `coding:pr create` owns PR publication and CI convergence.
- Before either sanctioned direct push, bind the exact pushed Git SHA and base,
  then invoke `coding:pr verify --target <sha> --base <sha> --kind standalone`.
  `--no-verify` never skips this direct-sync gate. Passing it does not make a
  direct bookmark sync PR publication.
- NEVER rewrite merged-on-origin history without explicit consent. For a detected target, prompt through the graphical or structured user-input tool; default to the corrective-PR route in [merged.md](directions/merged.md). `--allow-rewrite-merged` skips the prompt.
- Every change MUST be self-contained: compile/type diagnostics + lint + applicable tests and affected-consumer builds pass for each change in isolation. Runtime tests apply to runtime behavior; focused compile-time tests apply only to allowed compiler-semantic promises under `TST-CORE-10`. A declaration-only change with neither test kind still runs its configured typecheck or equivalent diagnostics and affected-consumer builds; it must not receive a static-shape test. Shared files (package.json, tsconfig, lockfiles) evolve incrementally — no forward references.
- `--paths-from` is a closed-set save, not a path suggestion. Never save,
  stage, reset, stash, or rewrite a non-selected dirty path, and never continue
  when exact isolation or the before/after preservation proof is unavailable.
- The Conventional Commits subject regex MUST match BEFORE any mutation (see [commit-message standard](../../standards/commit/write.md)); no emoji prefixes in commit subjects.
- Follow the shared guide's linked-Git-worktree guard before editing or
  mutating history.
</IMPORTANT>

## Inputs

- **Required**: none — the route is read from working-copy state.
- **Optional** (history flags force a route; publication and behavior flags modify it):

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--prepare-paths-from=<scope-request>` | No-history preparation route for a lifecycle parent. Seal its ignored work-artifacts scope request into an immutable manifest and return the exact `--paths-from` invocation; do not save, finalize, or publish. |
| `--paths-from=<manifest>` | Save only the manifest's exact dirty `selected_paths`; validate the ignored work-artifacts manifest and use [./directions/manifest.md](directions/manifest.md). Requires `--manifest-sha256`. |
| `--manifest-sha256=<sha256>` | Expected SHA-256 of the exact manifest bytes. Valid only with `--paths-from`; prevents a path or manifest swap between lifecycle handoff and save. |
| `--retrospective` | Distribute pending edits into their owning prior changes. See `./directions/retrospective.md` and the shared Jujutsu guide. |
| `--reorder [--up-to <rev>]` | Reorder history into a clean linear chain up to target rev (default `main@origin`). Content-equivalence guard via `verify.sh`. See `./directions/reorder.md`. |
| `--create-pr` | Compatibility entrypoint: finish the selected save/history route, then invoke `coding:pr create` with the resolved change or stack. |
| `--branch-prefix <name>` | Forward the branch/bookmark prefix to `coding:pr create` when `--create-pr` is present. |
| `--no-verify` | Skip this skill's ordinary pre-commit and post-commit project-script checks, including lint, type diagnostics, consumer builds, tests, and builds. It does not waive or pre-authorize the exact-revision gate before a PR handoff or sanctioned direct push. |
| `--dry-run` | Print the plan, don't mutate. |
| `--allow-rewrite-merged` | Explicit consent to rewrite history already merged on origin (skips the graphical or structured user-input tool corrective-PR prompt). |

- **Prerequisites**: a git repository, jj-colocated or not. The
  manifest-scoped route additionally requires a checksum-bound manifest under
  the resolved work root's ignored artifacts directory. Producer receipts must
  use the strict generated-files schema and reconcile exactly to the
  publication set. The helper capability-probes the shared guide's required
  operations and structural colocation; no version string alone authorizes the
  scoped route. Publication
  prerequisites are checked by `coding:pr create`. The directions above bind
  branch naming, earliest-owner fix routing, and public-history safety.
  Pull-request size and implementation-composition standards are review inputs
  and informational here.

## Workflow

The skill self-routes by reading the working-copy diff, the changes since the parent, and bookmark or branch state through whichever tool the repository uses. Open the matching reference file for the full procedure:

| Trigger | How invoked | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Prepare exact lifecycle scope | `--prepare-paths-from=<scope-request>` | `./directions/manifest.md` producer contract only |
| Exact lifecycle-owned save | `--paths-from=<manifest> --manifest-sha256=<sha256>` | `./directions/manifest.md` |
| Default save | (no flag) | `./directions/save.md` |
| Multiple concerns on `@` | auto-detected | `./directions/split.md` |
| User asks "edit commit X" | auto-detected | `./directions/edit.md` |
| Proposed work unrelated to current `@` | auto-detected | `./directions/parallel.md` |
| `@` is empty | auto-detected | `./directions/empty.md` |
| Divergent change ID | auto-detected | `./directions/divergent.md` |
| Target already merged on origin | auto-detected | `./directions/merged.md` |
| Blame-trace fixups into prior changes | `--retrospective` | `./directions/retrospective.md` |
| Reorder existing history | `--reorder [--up-to <rev>]` | `./directions/reorder.md` |
| Partial hunks → existing branch | user names a target branch + asks to save part of `@` | `./directions/partial.md` |
| Publish saved change or stack | `--create-pr` | Required handoff to `coding:pr create` after local history work |

Before writing any new code, plan the change structure so commits/PRs end up independent — see `./directions/plan.md`. End-to-end transcripts of every flag and auto-detected route: `./examples/transcripts.md`.

1. **Pre-flight.** Backup only runs for history-rewriting routes; plain saves (default, split, parallel, empty) do not touch prior changes and skip `backup.sh` entirely:

   | Route | Rewrites history? | Backup |
   |---|---|---|
   | Manifest-scoped save | No prior history | capture sealed VCS state plus the route's immutable exact-index backup and rollback handle |
   | Default save | No | skip |
   | Split current change | No | skip |
   | Parallel workspace | No | skip |
   | Empty / divergent | No | skip |
   | Edit prior change | Yes | run |
   | `--retrospective` | Yes | run |
   | `--reorder` | Yes | run |
   | Partial hunks → existing branch | Yes (ref movement, possibly backward) | run |
   | Correct merged target (`git rebase` fallback) | Yes | run |

   When backup runs, the PreToolUse hook fires it on the first rewriting op and injects `Auto-backup: GIT_TREE_SHA=... CONTENT_HASH=... BACKUP_PATH=...` into context. If the route rewrites history but the hook didn't fire, run manually:

   ```bash
   bash "${CODING_COMMIT_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/backup.sh"
   ```

   For every `jj` rewrite route, capture the rollback handle specified by the
   shared Jujutsu guide.

2. **Detect mode.** `--prepare-paths-from` runs only the producer contract and
   returns before proposing or mutating history; it cannot combine with another
   operation flag. A valid `--paths-from`/`--manifest-sha256` pair forces the
   manifest-scoped route and cannot be combined with `--retrospective`,
   `--reorder`, a named partial-to-branch target, or `--create-pr`. Otherwise,
   read working-copy state with the shared Jujutsu guide's inspection commands
   (or the route's Git equivalents) and pick exactly one route from the table
   above. A history-operation flag forces its route; `--create-pr` adds the
   post-save publication handoff.

3. **Propose the plan** to the user before any mutation. For multi-change routes (`--retrospective`, `--reorder`, `--create-pr`, auto-split), show the ordered list of operations. With `--dry-run`, skip local mutation but still perform the `coding:pr create --dry-run` handoff when `--create-pr` is present.

4. **Execute local history.** Complete the matching save/edit/reorder/parallel procedure and resolve the exact change or bottom-to-top stack. A manifest-scoped save must return its manifest hash, saved change ids, and a PASS preservation receipt before any later owner may continue. If its post-save proof fails, run the manifest reference's plain-Git `recover` command or restore the captured jj operation, prove the pre-save inventory again, and report `blocked_scope`; never leave an unproved saved change as success. Do not reproduce any bookmark, push, PR, restack, or CI workflow here except the bookmark move and direct-sync steps explicitly owned by the correct-merged and partial-to-branch references.

5. Run the verification below; when a check fails, fix the cause (or take the integrity table's prescribed action) and re-run that check. Repeat until every check passes or a concrete blocker remains — an integrity STOP awaiting the user, or a failure outside this skill's scope — then report the blocker instead of looping.

6. **Synchronize or hand off after local work is complete.** The correct-merged Option 2 and partial-to-branch references perform their own direct bookmark sync only after `coding:pr verify`; those syncs are not PR publication. With `--create-pr` on every other route, invoke `coding:pr create <resolved-change-or-stack>` and forward `--branch-prefix <name>` and `--dry-run` when present. Never forward `--no-verify`: the PR workflow runs its own exact-revision test and lint gate, and only it may ask for user approval when a required secret is missing. After another local rewrite affects an unmerged PR stack, report its resolved metadata and current PR states to the caller; do not invoke `coding:pr update`. A separately authorized PR action owns publication, restacking, base repair, and CI convergence.

## Verification

The PostToolUse hook auto-runs `verify.sh` after any successful rewriting op and prints `── Integrity Check ──` to stderr. Read the table:

| `GIT_TREE_MATCH` | `CONTENT_MATCH` | Action |
|---|---|---|
| PASS | PASS | OK → report |
| FAIL | PASS | git tree drift → STOP, show diff, await user |
| PASS | FAIL | filesystem drift → STOP, show diff, await user |
| FAIL | FAIL | corruption → STOP, restore the captured VCS operation |

If the hook didn't fire, run manually:

```bash
bash "${CODING_COMMIT_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/verify.sh"
```

Then run the project's own applicable lint, typecheck/diagnostics, affected-consumer build, test, and build commands (skip if `--no-verify`) and confirm the final chain is linear with each change self-contained. Runtime tests apply only to runtime behavior; focused compile-time tests apply only to allowed compiler-semantic promises under `TST-CORE-10`. For a declaration-only change with neither test kind, run its configured typecheck or equivalent diagnostics and affected-consumer builds, then record runtime and compiler tests as `SKIP (not applicable)` rather than running or inventing a test. Use configured project commands where they exist and the equivalents its language standard mandates otherwise.

The direct-sync publication gate in the two sanctioned push references is
separate from these ordinary checks and remains mandatory with `--no-verify`.

## Completion

Report the route taken (save, manifest-scoped save, split, edit, parallel,
retrospective, reorder, create-pr compatibility handoff, partial-to-branch,
empty, divergent, or correct-merged), changes touched (change IDs), any
directly synchronized bookmark, the last jj op id as the rollback handle, and
verification results — lint/type diagnostics/affected-consumer build/applicable
tests/build as PASS/SKIP/FAIL plus the integrity outcome. A manifest-scoped
result also reports the exact manifest path/hash,
selected paths, saved-tree hash evidence, preservation receipt, and whether all
non-selected dirty bytes and index/status entries remained identical. When a
plain-Git scoped save was recovered, report the immutable recovery receipt and
restored HEAD/index hash instead of a PASS preservation receipt. When
`--create-pr` ran, preserve the PR URLs and final green state returned by
`coding:pr create`; this skill itself never opens, updates, or polls PRs.
