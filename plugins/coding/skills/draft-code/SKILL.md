# Draft Code Skeleton

Before any `jj` decision or command, follow `coding:references/jj.md`.

Creates TypeScript-compliant production skeletons with explicit `TODO(implementation):` markers, type definitions, and function signatures. It may outline pending tests, but test markers belong to `coding:complete-test`; production stubs belong to `coding:complete-code`.

## Boundaries

- Use for: starting an already-specified implementation, or preparing typed production structure and test scaffolds for later completion.
- Do not use for: implementing business logic or producing production-ready code (`coding:write-code`), writing complete tests with assertions beyond the scaffold (`coding:complete-test`), or modifying existing implementations (`coding:refactor` or `coding:fix`).
- Reject when: the instruction is too vague to create meaningful types, the request is for implementation rather than a skeleton, the target directory does not exist, or the skeleton would conflict with existing code structure.

## Inputs

- **Required**: `<instruction>` — the feature or module to skeleton, specific enough to derive types, interfaces, and function signatures.
- **Optional**: a work ID/root and linked design/specification paths refine the skeleton's shape.
- **Prerequisites**: an existing target directory inside a TypeScript project.

## State gate

Before creating or materially rewriting a project artifact, read the absolute `state.md` path injected by Essential. If unavailable, stop artifact writes and report the missing contract. Resolve the workspace-local work root and artifact paths before drafting. When delegated, start from the mission capsule's exact work root and relevant design/spec files. Read `state/working.md` only when navigation is missing, and `state.md` only for resume, cross-slice dependency, or alignment work. Never write main-agent-owned pointers or overviews. The main-agent caller uses the resolver, asks only on `work_id_required`, and gives a delegated run the explicit resolved work ID/root.

Apply these constitution standards while drafting:

| Standard | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `documentation/write` | JSDoc structure and placeholder comments |
| `file-structure` | Project directory layout and organization |
| `function/write` | Function signatures, parameter types, return types |
| `naming/write` | Naming conventions for files, types, functions |
| `testing/write` | Test file structure, describe/it patterns |
| `typescript/write` | Type definitions, interfaces, generics |
| `universal/write` | General code authoring conventions |

## Workflow

1. Parse the instruction into required types, interfaces, functions, and file structure. Read only the work-local design/spec children and durable architecture/design/spec paths named by the caller or mission capsule. For a direct or resume run, use `state/working.md` and `state.md` to discover those paths. Read neighboring modules for established patterns. Do not scan unrelated Markdown or fall back to root continuation/design files.
2. Plan the structure before writing: file organization, type hierarchy, and test layout per the standards above.
3. Draft type definitions (interfaces, type aliases, enums) and function stubs with JSDoc, marking every incomplete body with the canonical placeholders in [references/drafting-patterns.md](references/drafting-patterns.md) — `TODO(implementation):` comments plus the `IMPLEMENTATION:` sentinel throw wherever a value is expected.
4. Draft the test structure: describe blocks per behavior, planned cases covering all functionality, and only the mock factories, fixtures, and helpers the skeleton needs. When no interface exists yet, use `describe.todo()`/`it.todo()`; once an interface exists, write real assertions that fail red until implementation — the desired TDD signal (details in references/drafting-patterns.md).
5. Run the verification below; when a check fails, fix the cause and re-run that check. Repeat until every check passes or a concrete blocker remains, then report the blocker instead of looping.

## Verification

- TypeScript compiles with no errors and all imports resolve (`npx tsc --noEmit` or the repository equivalent).
- `npm run lint` (or equivalent) passes; file organization and naming match the standards above.
- `npm run test` (or equivalent) runs without collection errors; scaffolded tests are pending or red exactly as designed.
- Every placeholder uses a canonical form from references/drafting-patterns.md — no bare `TODO:` markers, which `coding:complete-code` refuses to claim.

## Completion

Report the parsed instruction; context sources discovered; files created with a one-line purpose each; counts of types defined, functions drafted, and markers placed; verification commands with results; and next steps — complete production stubs with `coding:complete-code`, then route pending test markers to `coding:complete-test`. Return every created or materially rewritten path as `generated_files` to the main agent. Do not run file sizing; after all artifact writers finish, the main agent checks only eligible work Markdown inside the target `.state/`.
