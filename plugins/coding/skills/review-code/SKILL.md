# Review Code

Before any `jj` decision or command, follow `coding:directions/jj.md`.

Orchestrate a read-only code review. Area reviewers return seven canonical reports; the main agent writes the lowercase review areas beneath the active work root. Remediation belongs to `coding:fix`; mechanical enforcement belongs to `coding:lint`.

## Boundaries

- Review post-implementation changes, PRs, or explicit scopes across alignment, correctness, security, quality, testing, docs, and style.
- Do not edit reviewed code, build/deploy infrastructure, review dependencies, or write generic root `reviews/` output.
- Reject binary-only scopes. Reject `--out` with a migration message directing callers to `--work-id`; review paths are contract-owned.

## Inputs

- Optional specifier: file, directory, glob, package, PR, or git range.
- Optional `--area` canonical area list (default `all`), `--work-id`, `--plan=<path>` only as an assertion of the active root `state.md`, and `--explain` for a work-local change-comprehension child.
- Require a repository checkout and an active or explicit work ID.

## State gate

Before creating or materially rewriting a project artifact, read the absolute `state.md` path injected by Essential. If unavailable, stop artifact writes and report the missing contract. Resolve the work root before review. Run Essential's resolver normally, or with `--work-id` for an explicit user override or the identifier selected by Essential's work-stream lifecycle. Treat an existing match as a candidate and reuse it only when its charter owns the requested outcome. On `work_id_required`, a main-agent run follows that lifecycle to select an identifier and reruns without asking the user to approve it; a subagent returns the resolver payload unless it already received the resolved work ID and root. A main-agent run may use `state/working.md` and `state.md` to locate the plan/spec/design/review paths. A nested run starts from its mission capsule and reads broad work memory only for resume or cross-slice alignment. Subagents never write `.state`; they return proposed area content and roll-up deltas for the main agent to apply. Read the work item's `state.md` (and any `state/*.md` children) directly before dispatch. From the task table, determine `plan_source: state.md` and the applicable full task IDs (`task_id`); proceed on that reading — there is no separate validation step. An explicit `--plan` or delegated plan identity must match the report; never override or guess the canonical pointer from directory contents.

## Output contract

<report>

- Summary: `.state/works/<work-id>/review.md`.
- Areas under `.state/works/<work-id>/reviews/`:

  | Prefix | File | Question |
  |---|---|---|
  | `ALIGN` | `alignment.md` | approved state/spec/design adherence and drift |
  | `CORR` | `correctness.md` | semantic behavior and failure paths |
  | `SEC` | `security.md` | trust boundaries and vulnerabilities |
  | `QUAL` | `quality.md` | structure, consistency, complexity, maintainability |
  | `TEST` | `testing.md` | behavior evidence, coverage, fixtures, reliability |
  | `DOCS` | `docs.md` | code and durable documentation accuracy |
  | `STYL` | `style.md` | repository naming and mechanical-tool results |

- Each area follows [./templates/review.md](templates/review.md) and uses `open|fixed|acknowledged|deferred|skipped` finding status. IDs remain stable across reruns. `fixed` is closed only by verified evidence. `acknowledged` and `skipped` are closed non-fixed risk dispositions only with rationale, accountable owner, and explicit recheck condition; P0/P1 also require explicit risk-acceptance authority and durable evidence. `open`, `deferred`, and malformed risk dispositions remain outstanding and block review closure.
- The main agent rewrites `review.md` from every existing area file after writers finish. It contains overall status, all five disposition counts, derived `closed` and `outstanding` counts, priority counts for outstanding findings, one-line area headlines, paths, systemic patterns, and main-agent handback—not duplicated findings.
- With `--explain`, write a lowercase child under `changes/` using [./directions/explainer.md](directions/explainer.md); return it for main-agent reconciliation of `changes.md`.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the specifier and per-area file lists through [./directions/specifier-resolution.md](directions/specifier-resolution.md). Use root `state.md` as the only plan definition. An explicit `--plan` must resolve to that file. Follow only its explicit implementation-detail link, which may add ID-keyed procedure but cannot redefine IDs, edges, requiredness, targets, or acceptance mappings. Never auto-adopt another planning/design file.
2. Run the mandatory mechanical candidate scan described in [./directions/dispatch.md](directions/dispatch.md). Candidates are advisory.
3. Dispatch one read-only reviewer per selected area in one parallel batch, following [./directions/dispatch.md](directions/dispatch.md) and [references/mandates.md](references/mandates.md). Pass the canonical plan source (`state.md`) and applicable full task IDs. Each returns its assigned area's complete proposed content, counts, context level, and evidence. The main agent validates and writes the lowercase area file.
4. Re-read `state.md` before aggregation and reject plan-definition drift. Validate every expected selected file, then aggregate every existing canonical area so a partial rerun cannot hide unselected findings; reject malformed disposition metadata. For every reused (unselected) area file, compare its `reviewed_task_defs` binding against the current definitions of the same `reviewed_task_ids` in `state.md`; when a task kept its ID but its immutable definition (summary, targets, requiredness, acceptance) changed, treat that area as stale — do not aggregate it as clean, and require its re-review before closure. Derive outstanding findings as `open`, `deferred`, or malformed `acknowledged`/`skipped`; derive closed findings as verified `fixed` plus valid `acknowledged`/`skipped`. Any outstanding P0 is `fail`; outstanding P1 is `requires_changes`; only outstanding P2/P3 is `pass_with_suggestions`; zero outstanding findings is `pass`. Every outstanding finding blocks review closure regardless of displayed verdict. The main agent rewrites `review.md` entirely from the validated areas.
5. With `--explain`, generate the evidence-backed change child after review.
6. Render the final summary through [./templates/output.md](templates/output.md). On malformed output, redispatch only the owning area until valid or blocked.
7. Each writer follows `essential:references/output-manifest.md` while writing eligible work Markdown. The main agent returns all changed area, summary, and optional explainer paths in `generated_files`; a delegated reviewer returns no `.state` path as a file it wrote.

## Verification

- Every selected area file exists, is lowercase, matches the template, and contains only its owned findings.
- The written `review.md`, or returned roll-up delta, matches every existing area file's disposition/priority counts and paths.
- Alignment used the identical pinned state/plan/spec contract expected by any follow-up fix; no root fallback was selected. The result binds the exact `plan_source: state.md` and reviewed task IDs.
- Reviewed code was not modified.

## Completion

Report area verdicts, aggregate priorities/dispositions, overall status, `review.md` as `written_by_main` or `reconciliation_returned`, optional explainer child, `plan_source: state.md`, reviewed task IDs, and `generated_files`. Detailed findings remain in area files.
