<!-- INSTRUCTION: This is the companion template for an agent's `initialPrompt` frontmatter field — the short
     string every agent's claude.json carries (see templates/agent.md). `initialPrompt` fires ONLY on a no-task
     launch: when the agent is started as the session agent with no input, no task given. It governs just the
     agent's FIRST response — it does not run when the agent is spawned with a task. It is NOT a separate file on
     disk; it is the literal string value of `initialPrompt` in frontmatter/claude.json. This template exists so
     every agent's no-task response follows the same shape without reading as boilerplate. -->

# Role Prompt (initialPrompt) — Template

`initialPrompt` answers one question: *launched with no task, what does this agent do on its first turn?* The
answer is never "start working" — with no task there is nothing to work on. It is either **propose** (glance at
what's in front of it and offer the concrete work it would pick up) or **greet + state need** (say what artifact
or brief it needs before it can begin), and then wait.

## What it must NOT contain

- **No identity line.** Do not open with `You are the <role>.` — the role-only def-file body already
  establishes who it is. Open directly with the instruction.
- **No "no task" announcement.** Do not narrate `You've been launched with no task…` — that is the implicit
  context, not something to say back. Jump straight to the first move.
- **No preloaded context.** Do not tell it to load standards on start. A greeting shouldn't burn context on
  work that may not come; the agent selects applicable standard directories only when real work is named, then applies
  them under `essential:directions/standards.md`. It follows the matching posture clause below; `base.md`
  documents the same progressive contract.

## The three beats, in order

A short directive — 2–4 sentences, in the agent's own voice, as a flowing string:

1. **First move** — pick by role:
   - *propose* (role-fit — the next work is legible from repo/its area): take a light glance, then greet and
     propose the concrete work it'd pick up first, with a couple of examples.
   - *greet + state need* (it needs a human brief or an upstream artifact): greet, name plainly what it needs to
     begin, and what it'll do with it once handed over.
   A one-clause reason *why* it needs that, in voice, may lead.
2. **Wait** — an explicit "then wait for the user"; do not execute, edit, or spawn on this turn.
3. **Defer + posture + guardrail** — only once real work is named, it selects applicable standards and applies them
   under `essential:directions/standards.md` — as a writer, or as a read-only role against the owner-produced
   revision. Fold the role's one specific guardrail into this clause.

Keep it 2–4 sentences. It is a first-turn directive, not a spec restatement.

## Literal templates

Choose one first-move frame and append exactly one posture clause.

Propose (role's next work is legible from repo state):

```
<Light glance at X>, then greet the user and propose <the concrete work you'd pick up> — <1-2 examples>.
<POSTURE CLAUSE>
```

Greet + state need (role needs a brief or upstream artifact):

```
<One-clause why you need it>. Greet the user and say plainly what you need: <the artifact/brief>. Offer that
you'll <what you do with it>. <POSTURE CLAUSE>
```

Writer posture clause:

```
Then wait; once <real work is named>, select and apply applicable standards as a writer under
`essential:directions/standards.md`, and never <role guardrail>.
```

Read-only posture clause:

```
Then wait; once <an owner-produced revision or verification scope is named>, select and apply applicable
standards as a read-only reviewer under `essential:directions/standards.md`, and never <role guardrail>.
```

## Worked examples

Producer that proposes (Tech Lead — repo or plan state is enough to orient and decompose):

```
Lead by orienting, not executing. Take a quick read of the plan, backlog, or repo state, then greet the user and
propose how you'd decompose the engineering goal, which teammate advice should inform the approach, and who
should own each milestone. Ask them to confirm or redirect, then wait; once a real goal is named, select
and apply applicable standards as a writer under `essential:directions/standards.md`, own the resulting
technical decisions, and route team formation, teammate spawning, user questions, and scripted-execution
launches through the Project Manager.
```

Critic that greets (Code Quality Critic — the gate needs a change to run on):

```
The quality gate only runs on a change, and none is named yet. Greet the user and say plainly what you need:
point you at a diff, branch, or changed files to review. Offer that you'll rank findings by severity and escalate
to Security Champion or Adversarial Red-Team when depth warrants — but never edit the code, only report. Then
wait; once a real change is named, select and apply applicable standards as a read-only reviewer under
`essential:directions/standards.md`, against that owner-produced revision.
```

Leaf/mechanical that greets (Test Runner — terse register, runs what it's pointed at):

```
You're the on-demand sweep — you run what you're pointed at. Greet the user, short and plain, and say what you
need: the package or scope to sweep. Offer that you'll find the test/lint/type scripts, run the full sweep once,
and report the numbers clean. Then wait — you don't author tests or run speculatively; once there's a scope,
select and apply applicable standards as a read-only reviewer under `essential:directions/standards.md`,
against that owner-produced revision.
```

## Notes

- **Propose vs greet is a role property.** A role proposes only when its next work is visible without a human
  brief — a lead reading the plan, an initializer reading an empty directory, an optimizer reading the roster.
  Everything that needs an upstream artifact (a diff to review, an approved design to build, a hypothesis to
  test) greets and states the need instead. When in doubt, greet.
- The guardrail beat is where role identity survives compression — a generic "be careful" guardrail is a sign the
  prompt was written from the template, not the agent's own base.md. Derive it from what this specific role gets
  wrong most often.
- If the agent is `leaf:true`, the first move is greet-and-report, never "coordinate" or "delegate" — a leaf's
  `initialPrompt` must not imply spawning capability it does not have.
- If the agent is workflow-spawned or a teammate, do not restate `permissionMode` in the `initialPrompt` — that
  is a frontmatter concern (see templates/agent.md's permissionMode-by-launch-scenario table), not a voice
  concern.
